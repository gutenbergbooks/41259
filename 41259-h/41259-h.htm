<br />A Prize Contest</h2>
<p>A stir of excitement swept the room, causing the
Cub Scouts to shift restlessly in their seats.</p>
<p>The monthly meeting of the Pack was nearing its
end. Not a Cub from either Den 1 or Den 2 had
failed to attend, for Sam Hatfield, their leader, had
promised the boys &ldquo;a real surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, as a break came in the regular program, the
Cubs sensed that the moment for the long awaited
announcement had arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something worth while is in the wind, that&rsquo;s
sure,&rdquo; whispered Brad Wilber. The Den Chief spoke
to a sandy-haired boy whose nose was buried in a
book. &ldquo;Mr. Hatfield has kept his secret from everyone.
What do you think is up, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; demanded Dan Carter, coming suddenly
to life. Reluctantly he closed &ldquo;The Merry Adventures
of Robin Hood,&rdquo; a volume obtained a few
minutes earlier from the Webster City Public Library.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t bother that book worm,&rdquo; laughed
Midge Holloway, another Cub in Den 2. &ldquo;He never
hears anything that goes on at a meeting, even if
he is the official Denner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I resent that slur,&rdquo; retorted Dan goodnaturedly.
&ldquo;I hear every word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure he does,&rdquo; declared Chips Davis, coming to
the defense of his friend. &ldquo;Dan&rsquo;s just smart enough
never to waste any of his time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A loud, offensive snicker greeted this remark.
Looking quickly across the cave, the Cubs of Den 2
saw that the offender was Ross Langdon, a tall,
gangling boy in Den 1.</p>
<p>Now Dan and Ross always had been athletic
rivals. In a recent swimming contest the Den 2
boy had soundly defeated the older lad. Ross hadn&rsquo;t
taken it too well. Whenever an opportunity afforded,
he made belittling remarks.</p>
<p>The Cubs of Den 2, Brad, Red Suell, Chips,
Midge and Fred Hatfield, the son of their leader,
were in no mood to &ldquo;take&rdquo; anything from Ross. So
they pinned him with hard glares, and Midge muttered:
&ldquo;Quiet, you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say a word,&rdquo; retorted Ross, pretending
innocence. &ldquo;You were the one who remarked that
Dan never hears anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Midge would have uttered a sharp retort had not
Dan given him a nudge in the ribs. He was willing
to overlook the snicker, because he&rsquo;d made up his
mind to have no trouble with Ross.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Pack meetings came only once a
month unless Mr. Hatfield called the gang together
for something special.</p>
<p>At the regular weekly gatherings of Den 2, everything
went smooth as silk because Ross never attended.
However, the Cubs of Den 1 reported that
their sessions sometimes were a bit rough as a result
of the older boy&rsquo;s desire to boss everyone.</p>
<p>Before Ross could pass another remark, Mr. Hatfield
took the floor. Signaling for silence, he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellows, I have an interesting announcement to
make. I don&rsquo;t know how this will strike you, but a
sporting goods firm&mdash;Fielding &amp; Jones Corp.&mdash;has
offered a substantial prize to the organization putting
on the best play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of prize?&rdquo; demanded Dan quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A complete archery set. Practice and tournament
targets, bows and arrows&mdash;everything. All first
class equipment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds okay,&rdquo; nodded Brad. Thirteen years of
age, the Den Chief was also a Boy Scout and very
dependable for his years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many organizations will compete?&rdquo; inquired
Midge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to guess,&rdquo; the Cub leader replied.
&ldquo;I know several church clubs are entering the contest.
Now, I thought if the fellows are interested,
we might make it a joint Den 1 and Den 2 project.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell!&rdquo; approved Chips Davis. &ldquo;That way, we&rsquo;ll
have a bigger field from which to draw acting
talent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it!&rdquo; approved Midge, while the other
boys in Den 2 nodded vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we hear from Den 1,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>With the exception of Ross Langdon, all the other
boys were in favor of joining forces to try to win the
prize. Ross remained noncommittal, thinking it
over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that it&rsquo;s settled we&rsquo;re to make the play a
joint affair, I&rsquo;m open to suggestions,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
resumed. &ldquo;Any bang-up ideas?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make it an Indian pow-wow!&rdquo; proposed
Ross. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a lot of costumes already sewed
that we can use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield nodded and waited for other suggestions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An Indian script would be old stuff,&rdquo; protested
Dan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first idea that pops into one&rsquo;s mind.
Probably a dozen other organizations will come up
with the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ve got a better idea!&rdquo; Ross scoffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, I haven&rsquo;t at the moment,&rdquo; Dan admitted,
and then his gaze rested for a moment on
the Robin Hood book. &ldquo;Yes, I have too!&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear it, Dan,&rdquo; invited Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;If
we&rsquo;re to win first prize, we need the best idea we
can get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not build our play around the adventures
of Robin Hood?&rdquo; Dan proposed. &ldquo;Remember? He
was the famous archer who lived with his men in
the green glades of Sherwood Forest near Nottingham
Town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was in the time of King Henry the Second,
wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Brad asked, taking up with the idea.
&ldquo;The forest setting would be dandy, and we could
have green costumes!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And throw in a little real archery,&rdquo; added Fred.
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t Robin Hood expert at it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very best,&rdquo; Dan declared, paraphrasing the
book he had just been reading. &ldquo;&lsquo;No archer ever
lived that could speed a gray goose shaft with more
skill than he.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wants to do Robin Hood?&rdquo; Ross cut in. &ldquo;An
Indian pow-wow would be more fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indians are old stuff,&rdquo; Chips Davis said. &ldquo;Tell us
more about Robin Hood, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would take some doing, because it&rsquo;s a long
book. I&rsquo;ll tell you how the story begins though. One
day Robin Hood came upon a group of foresters
who twitted him about his ability as an archer.
Robin Hood won a wager with them by shooting
a deer. The foresters were jealous and turned upon
him. One of the men shot an arrow at Robin Hood,
who returned the shot. Unfortunately, he killed the
man, and became an outlaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing in that idea,&rdquo; broke in Ross. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in
favor of the Indian pow-wow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, peddle your feathers somewhere else,&rdquo; cut
in another member of Den 1. &ldquo;Dan&rsquo;s idea sounds
good! Tell us some more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Robin Hood always befriended the poor people,&rdquo;
Dan explained. &ldquo;The book would provide any number
of exciting scenes, including a big archery
tournament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What characters could we have?&rdquo; demanded
Red Suell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The main part would go to Robin Hood. Then
we could have the Sheriff of Nottingham, Little
John, foresters, the tinker, the king, Eric O&rsquo;Lincoln,
the cook, Allan-a-Dale, the merry friar, and a dozen
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it!&rdquo; urged Brad. &ldquo;The play would be
a lot of fun and give the fellows a chance to practice
with bows and arrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield brought the proposal to a vote. Ross
Langdon was the only Cub who held out for the
Indian pow-wow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to go along on the Robin Hood idea
if I can have his part,&rdquo; he said grudgingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Modest, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Midge twitted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ross probably has a good reason for wanting the
lead part,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield quickly. &ldquo;How about
it, Ross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy flushed and looked a bit ashamed. &ldquo;Oh,
I don&rsquo;t want to be Robin Hood just to have the lead
part,&rdquo; he defended himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not settle for one of the foresters?&rdquo;
demanded Red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I figure the one who plays Robin Hood should
be the best archer in the Pack. Well, that&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a modest little guy!&rdquo; Midge snorted. &ldquo;I
bet you can hit the bull&rsquo;s-eye every time at three
paces back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good and you know it!&rdquo; Ross insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re good and <i>you</i> know it,&rdquo; Midge growled.
&ldquo;Of all the conceit&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, boys,&rdquo; said the Cub leader, breaking
off what promised to be a lively argument.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not quarrel about who has this or that part.
When the time comes, they&rsquo;ll be assigned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think Robin Hood should be good
with a bow and arrow?&rdquo; Ross demanded. &ldquo;In the
tournament scene, wouldn&rsquo;t it be something if he
couldn&rsquo;t hit the target?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree that the part of Robin Hood should be
played by the Cub most skilled with a bow and
arrow,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll determine that by
having a preliminary contest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me,&rdquo; grinned Ross, pushing back his chair.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the same as Robin Hood right now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, one more surprise,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said, as the
boys started to leave their places. &ldquo;One of the Den
Dads, Mr. Holloway, has a moving picture camera.
He will make a movie of the play as we work it
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will we take the pictures?&rdquo; Dan asked.
&ldquo;Here at the Cave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room which the Cubs used in summer time
for their meeting place was high over the beach,
reached by a long flight of stairs. Barely large
enough to hold all the boys at one time, it never
would provide a suitable background for the Robin
Hood play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to find ourselves a forest primeval
to double for Sherwood Forest,&rdquo; Brad chuckled. &ldquo;I
know just the place too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; demanded Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out west of the city near the Haunted Castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Haunted Castle!&rdquo; repeated Midge with keen
interest. &ldquo;Never heard of such a place. How&rsquo;d it
get that name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad admitted that it was one he had made up.
&ldquo;The forest adjoins an old place that resembles a
deserted castle,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;When last I visited
the area, no one lived there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it really haunted?&rdquo; asked Chips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now what do you think?&rdquo; laughed Brad. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
yet to meet an honest-to-goodness ghost. But if
there were any, the Castle would be an ideal home
for the old boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we investigate the Haunted Castle and
the forest,&rdquo; proposed Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;The setting
sounds first class to me, if we can get permission to
use the grounds. Who owns the place, Brad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know sir, but I can find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would before our next meeting. If
we&rsquo;re aiming to win the prize, we&rsquo;ll have to get busy
on the play right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look into the matter today,&rdquo; Brad promised.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic over the prospect of acting in Robin
Hood, the other Cubs urged Mr. Hatfield to call
another Pack meeting that coming Saturday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; he consented. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a
hike. How would you like to go out to the Haunted
Castle and look over the place? If Ross cares to
bring along his archery set, we might get in a little
practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll fetch the equipment,&rdquo; Ross offered
willingly enough. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see I wasn&rsquo;t boasting when
I said I can hit the bull&rsquo;s-eye.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give you a thorough test,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
responded dryly.</p>
<p>The hour had come to close the meeting. After
singing one of their songs, the Cubs said good-bye
to Mr. Hatfield and started off in little groups.</p>
<p>Descending the steps to the beach, Brad and
Midge walked with Dan. Just ahead, they could
hear Ross complaining to a Den 1 Cub that the
Robin Hood idea wasn&rsquo;t nearly as good as the one
he had proposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, forget it,&rdquo; the other boy advised. &ldquo;Indians
are stale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the Robin Hood idea is original,&rdquo; Ross
retorted.</p>
<p>Brad, Dan and Midge knew Ross well enough to
realize that he was not likely to let the matter drop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a hunch he&rsquo;ll make trouble before we&rsquo;re
through,&rdquo; Brad said in an undertone. &ldquo;If he gets to
be Robin Hood, he may go along. If not&mdash;well, he&rsquo;ll
kick up a lot of dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him try,&rdquo; replied Midge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chances are Ross will win the part fair and
square,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;We all know that despite his
boasting he probably handles a bow and arrow
better than anyone in the Pack.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If he gets the part, the play is the same as
ruined,&rdquo; Midge predicted.</p>
<p>Brad, however, refused to take such a pessimistic
view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Ross won&rsquo;t win,&rdquo; he said cheerfully. &ldquo;It
hasn&rsquo;t been proven yet that he&rsquo;s the best shot. Wait
until Saturday. Once we get to the Haunted Castle
he may whistle a different tune.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>

<br />The Chimney Niche</h2>
<p>Early Saturday afternoon found the Cub Scouts
of both Den 1 and 2 hiking briskly along a deserted
road leading to &ldquo;The Castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately after the previous week&rsquo;s Pack meeting
at the Cave, Brad had inquired as to the ownership
of the property, learning that the Webster City
Savings Bank held title.</p>
<p>Further, he had been told that the mansion had
been built twenty-two years earlier by Gorman
Lubell, a millionaire who had lost his fortune in the
stock market.</p>
<p>The unusual dwelling had been built of massive
stone to resemble a miniature English castle. The
interior never had been completely finished. Year
after year, the Castle had stood deserted. Periodically,
the bank cut the weeds and trimmed back
the shrubbery, but of late even this duty had been
neglected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Brad, you obtained permission for us to visit the
property, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield asked as the
boys trudged along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bank president was out of the city,&rdquo; the boy
answered. &ldquo;I talked to his secretary though. She said
she was sure it would be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if we find the grounds unsuited as a locale
for our play, we can get in some archery practice,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield remarked.</p>
<p>To make certain that equipment would be available,
Mr. Holloway, one of the Den Dads, had
driven on ahead to set up a target. He had borrowed
several bows for the occasion, and Ross had
brought his sets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever do any shooting, Dan?&rdquo; Brad asked his
friend as they presently approached the bank property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little, but it was more than a year ago. No
chance I&rsquo;ll give Ross any competition for the Robin
Hood role.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, maybe you will,&rdquo; the older boy encouraged
him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re good at most games requiring skill.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ross has had more practice than any of the
Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Brad admitted. &ldquo;He may win the role.
I hope not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ross, apparently sensing that he was being discussed,
approached the two boys. Brad and Dan
immediately fell silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plotting something?&rdquo; Ross demanded suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Brad replied. Of all the Cubs
in the Pack, Ross was the only one who rubbed him
the wrong way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you say something about Robin Hood,&rdquo;
Ross declared. &ldquo;I guess you figure you&rsquo;ll nail the
role for someone in Den 2.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be stupid!&rdquo; Brad exclaimed impatiently.
&ldquo;You heard Mr. Hatfield say the part will go to the
best archer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who will be chosen through an elimination contest,&rdquo;
Dan added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll win too, if the competition is fair and
square!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you give me a pain!&rdquo; Brad exploded. &ldquo;You
know very well it will be on the level. Maybe you
think you were cheated when Dan beat you in the
swimming meet last summer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ross flushed and shifted the archery equipment
to another hand. The lost swimming meet was a
sore subject with him.</p>
<p>Dan had defeated him soundly in a fair race.
Ross remembered too that after the contest the
younger boy had been kidnapped by a crook who
had previously tangled with the Cubs. This adventure
has been recounted in the volume entitled,
&ldquo;Dan Carter and the River Camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a result of his experience with water front
thieves, Dan had gained considerable attention in
Webster City. Ross, who liked the limelight, had
rather resented the younger boy&rsquo;s gain in popularity.</p>
<p>Hence, he was more than ever determined that
Dan should not win the leading role in the Robin
Hood play.</p>
<p>The Cubs presently arrived at the old Lubell
property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; Dan noted, observing the
familiar car parked by the roadside. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s set up
the target too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>Beyond the clearing which the Den Dad had
selected for an archery range, rose a heavily wooded
area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like Sherwood Forest in England!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed.
&ldquo;Say, this place should be all right for our
play!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That castle has atmosphere too,&rdquo; Brad agreed,
highly pleased.</p>
<p>The building was a large, sprawling structure of
many towers and turrets. A luxurious growth of
vines covered the walls and blocked off some of the
windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say that building has thousands of dollars&rsquo;
worth of imported marble in it,&rdquo; Brad said, staring
at the desolate dwelling. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a big white elephant
now. A pity it never was finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Lubell ran out of money?&rdquo; Dan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he lost every penny he owned and was on
charity at the time of his death. The bank never was
able to find a buyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless the property gets some care pretty soon,
it will fall into complete ruin,&rdquo; Dan remarked.</p>
<p>His attention had been drawn to a smashed window
pane. He noticed also that the foundation of
the house had been damaged in several places.
Walls remained in excellent condition however, and
also the tall chimneys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ll bet that place has some dandy fire
places!&rdquo; he commented.</p>
<p>The other Cubs had gathered about and were
eager to explore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can find a ghost,&rdquo; chuckled Red, gazing
with keen interest at the castle cupolas. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
see what the place looks like inside, fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the Den Chief replied
doubtfully. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say anything at the bank about
exploring the interior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy enough to get in,&rdquo; Red urged. &ldquo;All one
has to do is reach through one of those broken window
panes and unlatch the catch. From the look of
this place, plenty of folks have been in there ahead
of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bank might not like it,&rdquo; Brad said, holding
back.</p>
<p>Before the Cubs could discuss the question further,
Mr. Hatfield and Burton Holloway called them
together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking over the grounds,&rdquo; Midge&rsquo;s
father declared. &ldquo;This place will make an almost
perfect Robin Hood setting for our movie. The
castle gives just the background touch needed, and
will fit in with the story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A brook runs behind the castle too!&rdquo; announced
Fred, who had made a brief inspection tour. &ldquo;The remains
of a draw bridge still is there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can use it in the first scene of our play,&rdquo; Dan
declared enthusiastically. &ldquo;The one where Robin
Hood meets Little John on the narrow bridge and
neither will give way to the other. They fight with
cudgels until, after hours of struggle, Robin Hood
topples into the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ought to make a corking scene,&rdquo; approved
Midge. He added darkly, &ldquo;Especially if Ross is
Robin Hood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why Robin Hood should be the one
to get a ducking,&rdquo; Ross protested as he strung his
bow ready for target practice. &ldquo;Why not have Little
John be the one to lose out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it wasn&rsquo;t that way,&rdquo; Dan told him.
&ldquo;Little John proved himself a fine fighter and a good
shot, so Robin Hood and his merry men allowed
him to join the band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s elect Ross the Sheriff of Nottingham,&rdquo;
chuckled Chips, in jest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like fun!&rdquo; Ross retorted. &ldquo;Just bring on your
target and I&rsquo;ll show you I can hit the gold band
every time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eager to try their skill, the Cubs lined up ready
to take instruction from Mr. Holloway. With the
exception of Ross, Dan and Midge, the other boys
had never tried archery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing we learn is how to face the target,&rdquo;
the Den Dad instructed. &ldquo;Look straight ahead
and extend your left arm out to the side. Heels together.
Relax!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kindergarten stuff,&rdquo; muttered Ross impatiently.</p>
<p>Ignoring the boy, Mr. Holloway explained the
fundamentals of the sport. He told the boys to draw
the string with their first three fingers of the right
hand, avoiding the use of thumb or little finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you have the arrow on the string, sight
over the arrow point,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look up
until you hear the arrow hit the target. If you do,
you will miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Midge took his turn first. He drew the string back
to his chin, closed his left eye and let the arrow
fly. Ping!</p>
<p>It struck the target but on the lower rim. After
his father had told him how to correct his aim,
Chips took the bow. On the first shot he hit his left
arm with the bowstring, receiving a painful
bruise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Remember your fundamentals and that won&rsquo;t
occur,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway said. &ldquo;Elbow bent, wrist
straight, shoulder low, index finger under the jawbone
and the string to the center of the chin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s turn came next. His form was excellent
despite lack of practice. Two of his arrows went in
the gold and the other four in a group in the next
ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad, Dan!&rdquo; Mr. Holloway approved. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
see you beat that, Ross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ross confidently took his place in front of the
target. With easy grace he sent an arrow winging
on its way. It struck the bull&rsquo;s-eye, causing the Cubs
to cheer lustily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, didn&rsquo;t I tell you?&rdquo; Ross demanded.</p>
<p>He shot two more arrows. Both missed the target
completely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little out of practice,&rdquo; Ross muttered. Instead
of shooting the remainder of his arrows, he
handed the bow to a Cubmate from Den 1.</p>
<p>For nearly an hour the boys practiced, some acquiring
the art readily and others finding it difficult
to catch on to the trick of relaxing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll definitely assign parts next time,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
told the boys. &ldquo;Off hand, I think Fred will
make a good Friar Tuck and Brad could act the
part of Little John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I get to be Robin Hood?&rdquo; Ross demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be decided later,&rdquo; the Cub leader replied,
a trifle annoyed that the Den 1 boy should
make such an issue of the role. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need a good
actor for the part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While some of the Cubs remained to practice
archery and pose for camera shots, Dan, Brad,
Midge and Ross set off to explore the castle.</p>
<p>Long shadows extended from the forest to give
the castle a shadowy, eerie appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, the place does have a spooky look,&rdquo; Brad
remarked, pulling at the vines which half-covered
one of the lower windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s climb in,&rdquo; proposed Ross, gaining a foothold
on one of the stone blocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we should&mdash;&rdquo; Dan began, but Ross
cut him short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the place is wide open. Why shouldn&rsquo;t we
go in?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>Reaching his hand through the broken window
pane, he unlatched the catch. The leaded window
swung back on creaking hinges.</p>
<p>Ross climbed in and helped the others through.</p>
<p>The Cubs found themselves in the central living
room. One wall had been paneled but the others
never had been finished. The main point of interest
was a huge fireplace ornamented with imported
tiles in an old English hunting scene design.</p>
<p>Crossing to the hearth, Dan gazed curiously up
the deep chimney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Filled with old bird&rsquo;s nests,&rdquo; he reported.</p>
<p>Dan ran a stick part way up the chimney, knocking
down some of the debris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Quit it,&rdquo; Ross commanded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re stirring
up an awful dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s stick had lodged between two loose bricks.</p>
<p>To free it, he reached up and moved the bricks
slightly. Much to his astonishment, one of them
pulled out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This old chimney is falling apart,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Either that or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or what?&rdquo; Brad demanded.</p>
<p>Rather excited, Dan thrust his arm far up the
chimney and groped about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Find anything?&rdquo; Brad demanded eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; Dan murmured, as his fingers continued
to explore. &ldquo;Yes, I think that brick was set
loose on purpose. Sure as shooting, I can feel a deep
niche in the chimney&mdash;a hiding place!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER 3</span>
<br />Robin Hood&rsquo;s Strong Box</h2>
<p>Excited by Dan&rsquo;s discovery, the other three boys
clustered about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me look up that chimney,&rdquo; Ross said. In his
eagerness to see, he rather rudely shoved Dan
aside.</p>
<p>The Den 1 boy thrust his arm far up the dirty
flue, groping about in the niche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing here,&rdquo; he reported in disgust. &ldquo;Not a
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could have told you that if you&rsquo;d have given
me a chance,&rdquo; said Dan, still annoyed by the older
boy&rsquo;s lack of manners. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dandy hiding place
though, and deserves a name. Let&rsquo;s call it Robin
Hood&rsquo;s Strong Box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and your kid games!&rdquo; Ross scoffed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just
a hole behind a loose brick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad had taken his turn at examining the niche.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it was built into the chimney as a hiding
place,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate, it would make a good one,&rdquo; added
Midge, siding with Dan. &ldquo;What better name for it
than Robin Hood&rsquo;s Strong Box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in favor of that name say &lsquo;aye&rsquo;,&rdquo; directed
Brad.</p>
<p>Ross voted a very loud &ldquo;no&rdquo; which the other Cubs
ignored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ayes have it,&rdquo; Brad announced.</p>
<p>As he spoke, the Cubs distinctly heard footsteps
in a corridor adjoining the room where they stood.
They listened a moment, thinking that another Cub
had followed them into the house.</p>
<p>But the footsteps, instead of coming closer, receded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; called Brad. &ldquo;Is that you, Fred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer.</p>
<p>Certain that someone had been in the house, the
boys quickly went through the lower rooms. All
were deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; Dan said, deeply puzzled. &ldquo;I was
sure I heard someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounded as if whoever it was might have been
sneaking up on us too,&rdquo; Midge added uneasily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you guys have been reading too much Robin
Hood,&rdquo; Ross muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen enough of this
old place. Let&rsquo;s explore outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan and the others would have preferred to roam
through the mansion for a while longer. However,
to avoid an argument with Ross, they gave in to
him.</p>
<p>Leaving by the same window through which they
had entered, Brad fastened the catch behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if the bank knows this window is
broken?&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll drop in there
tomorrow and tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good idea,&rdquo; approved Dan. &ldquo;Prowlers could
do a lot of damage here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In returning to the archery range, the Cubs chose
a by-path which led past a narrow, pebbly brook.</p>
<p>The ribbon of water was spanned by a narrow
bridge constructed from two logs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this place is made to order for our Robin
Hood movie!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed as he saw the log
bridge. &ldquo;Just the props we need for a scene between
Robin and Little John!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be Robin Hood, I take it?&rdquo; Ross cut in,
annoyed that the younger boy should think of all
the ideas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pipe down, Ross!&rdquo; Brad silenced him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard Mr. Hatfield say that role will be
chosen after we have an archery contest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ross may play the bridge scene if he wants
to,&rdquo; Dan said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty generous of you,&rdquo; Ross retorted. &ldquo;You
know I&rsquo;ll win the part anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure of that,&rdquo; Midge cut in. &ldquo;If I
remember correctly, you made that same boast&mdash;that
you would win&mdash;the time we had the swimming
meet. Remember? Dan didn&rsquo;t have much to say,
but he came in ahead and won the cup for the
Den.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, I was off form that week,&rdquo; Ross muttered.
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t even need to practice to beat all the Cubs
at archery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Modest, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Brad grinned. &ldquo;Well, time
will tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four boys returned to the archery range
where Mr. Hatfield was instructing the Cubs. He
warned them that one might be injured by thrusting
the breast into the way of the bowstring, or by
overdrawing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;While you are learning, it is better never to practice
unless Mr. Holloway or I can be with you,&rdquo;
he advised.</p>
<p>He added, however, that Ross, Dan, Brad and
Midge, who understood fairly well how to handle a
bow, might be excepted from the rule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had enough practice for one day, I think,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield ended the session. &ldquo;Now to assign a
few of the roles&mdash;tentatively, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I Robin Hood?&rdquo; demanded Ross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not select that role today,&rdquo; the Cub leader
replied. &ldquo;Probably before the final choice is made,
several boys will be tried out in the part. Acting
ability as well as archery skill is required, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield then announced that Brad had been
selected for the role of Little John. Midge would be
Friar Tuck and Chips would play Allan-a-Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to take at least one scene this afternoon
to test out lighting effects,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway told the
boys. &ldquo;The film probably won&rsquo;t be used in the final
screening, but it will point up some of the defects
we must overcome. Any ideas for a test scene,
boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan has one,&rdquo; grinned Brad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway invited.</p>
<p>Dan described the brook with the log bridge.
&ldquo;The setting would be perfect for a prologue scene
between Little John and Robin Hood,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;But since Robin Hood hasn&rsquo;t been selected&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to play the part,&rdquo; Ross broke in. &ldquo;Dan
can take his turn trying out later on. I want to do
the first scene with Brad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Holloway, his eyes twinkling.
&ldquo;Suppose you describe the scene, Dan. Tell
us what happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robin Hood meets Little John at the bridge.
Both seek to cross first. To settle the dispute, they
cut themselves cudgels and duel with them on the
log bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little John gets pushed in?&rdquo; Ross asked with
relish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; chuckled Dan. &ldquo;Robin Hood is the loser
in this contest, and tumbles into the soup. Then he
blows three blasts on his horn and all the members
of his band swarm out of the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Robin Hood should get a ducking,&rdquo;
Ross protested quickly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not in keeping with
the star part.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in keeping with the story,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway
assured him. &ldquo;We must keep our script true to fact,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not keen to take a ducking,&rdquo; Ross announced.
&ldquo;Dan may do the first scene. I&rsquo;ll take my
turn later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Chips said quickly. &ldquo;You
asked for the part, so you get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can omit the ducking today,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway
settled the matter. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brought his moving picture camera equipment
from the car and joined the boys at the bridge.
Brad and Ross armed themselves with sticks cut
from branches of a tree.</p>
<p>After the scene had been fully discussed, the
two boys took their places on either side of the
bridge. The other Cubs from both Den 1 and 2 remained
in the woods, ready to swarm out when
Robin Hood should blow three shrill blasts on his
horn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re minus a horn today, but by our next practice
we&rsquo;ll have one,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said. &ldquo;Also, the
Den mothers have promised to help us out by making
Lincoln green woodsmen costumes for all who
act in the play.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>The filming of the scene began. Repeatedly Ross
had to be warned by Mr. Hatfield to &ldquo;take it
easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the script called for him to be tumbled
into the water, he seemed determined that Brad
should be pushed off the log.</p>
<p>Back and forth Brad and Ross whacked with their
sticks as the film recording was made.</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway was on the verge of signaling the
end of the scene, when the Den 1 boy made a quick
lunge at Brad. The latter moved sideways, failing
entirely to parry the blow with his own stick.</p>
<p>Caught off balance, Ross fell slightly forward and
lost his footing. Before he could save himself or
Brad could offer a helping hand, he fell sideways
into the shallow water.</p>
<p>As Ross sprawled amid the lily pads, the watching
Cubs burst into laughter. The day was warm
and the creek waters exceedingly shallow. The
ducking, they knew, would do the boy no harm,
and was a fate quite deserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right, Ross?&rdquo; Mr. Holloway asked.</p>
<p>Putting aside his camera, he ran to help the boy.</p>
<p>Still chuckling at the mishap, the other Cubs
gathered around.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Brad did that on purpose!&rdquo; Ross said, angrily
pulling off a lily pad which had plastered against
his face. &ldquo;Look at me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a little dampish,&rdquo; Brad grinned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry you slipped. I didn&rsquo;t touch your stick, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This scene is stupid!&rdquo; Ross fumed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had
enough of Robin Hood for one day! I&rsquo;m going
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway offered sympathetically.
&ldquo;You should get into dry clothes right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the two walked toward the parked car, Ross
made a sorry sight indeed. His shoes and trousers
were caked with mud and a lily pad still clung to
the back of his shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a ripping scene,&rdquo; Brad laughed, once
Ross was beyond hearing. &ldquo;Falling into the brink
may cure that know-it-all of wanting to hog the
best scenes. I thought I&rsquo;d die laughing when he
fell in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t the only one,&rdquo; said Dan in an odd
tone of voice. &ldquo;Did you hear laughter from the
woods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the woods?&rdquo; Brad echoed, rather mystified.
&ldquo;The other Cubs, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dan replied soberly. &ldquo;The laughter came
from far off. It was a strange, almost ghostly laugh.
I think it came from the general direction of the
castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is queer, Dan. None of the Cubs were over
there during the filming of the brook scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Dan admitted with an uneasy chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you think it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Dan replied. &ldquo;It seems though,
that our castle may be haunted. And by a ghost
with a keen sense of humor!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER 4</span>
<br />Laughter from the Woods</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear any laughter from the woods,&rdquo;
Brad said, gazing thoughtfully toward the fringe of
trees beyond the castle. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you heard it,
Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positive,&rdquo; the younger boy replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was one of the Den 1 Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone was right here watching the filming of
the bridge scene. I checked to make certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see anyone in the woods,&rdquo; Brad
said. &ldquo;We might take a look around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This proposal appealed to Dan. However, before
the two boys could leave the creek, they heard an
automobile drive up from the main road.</p>
<p>To the surprise of the Cubs, the car stopped nearby.
A stout man in a gray suit alighted and came
toward the group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the bank officials, I&rsquo;ll bet a cookie!&rdquo;
Brad murmured. &ldquo;Now what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curious to learn what the stranger wanted, Mr.
Holloway and Ross rejoined the group of Cubs. The
man approached them, addressing Sam Hatfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he greeted the Cub leader, &ldquo;I
am Grover Kain, sent out by the bank to inspect the
grounds here. I see you&rsquo;re getting in a little archery
practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed the Cub leader. &ldquo;We need
a longer archery field though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Kain nodded as his gaze roved over the
grounds which had grown up with bushes and were
cluttered with brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust you&rsquo;ll be careful about starting fires,&rdquo; he
remarked. &ldquo;The season is unusually dry and brush
presents a hazard. If a fire should start in this area,
it would be most difficult to fight it because of the
scarcity of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield assured him that the Cub Scouts
would be careful.</p>
<p>His answer did not entirely satisfy the bank
official, who walked about the premises making note
of work that needed to be done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Someone should call that broken window to his
attention,&rdquo; Dan suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; offered Ross. &ldquo;Having it fixed will
spoil a lot of our fun though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Kain spent nearly ten minutes looking over
the property and then returned to talk to Mr. Hatfield
and Midge&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to put a damper on your good times
here,&rdquo; he said apologetically. &ldquo;But in looking over
the grounds I am more than ever impressed with
the fire hazard. Boys don&rsquo;t mean to cause trouble,
but they are careless with matches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the Cubs,&rdquo; spoke up Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;They
know and practice the rules of safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much dry brush is a distinct danger. I dislike
to say the Cubs can&rsquo;t use this property, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an idea,&rdquo; proposed Mr. Holloway, well
aware that the bank official intended to forbid the
Cubs from filming their picture on the grounds.
&ldquo;The boys will pitch in and clear out some of the
brush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Kain was both pleased and astonished by the
offer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That would be fine!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;In that case,
we have no objection whatsoever to the property
being used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three men discussed what work should be
done before Mr. Kain returned to the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get at it right away,&rdquo; proposed Brad. &ldquo;We
can map our areas and have each Cub responsible
for a certain section.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t the bank clean its own rubbish?&rdquo;
Ross growled. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help because I&rsquo;ve got to go
home and get into dry clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway offered again.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pick up rakes and return by lunch time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proposal rather displeased Ross, who never
liked to work. But knowing that the other Cubs
would call him a quitter if he made an excuse for
not returning to the castle grounds, he scowled and
made no reply.</p>
<p>After Mr. Holloway and Ross had driven away,
the others marked the area into sections and then
set about clearing away the debris.</p>
<p>Loose brush was accumulated in a large bare spot
near the road ready for burning. The Cubs worked
with a will and by the time Ross and Mr. Holloway
came back with garden tools, were fairly well along.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ross, your section is that area behind the castle,&rdquo;
Brad gave him his assignment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My section? Say, I&rsquo;m all tired out from archery
practice and chasing back and forth. What does
that bank guy think we are anyhow? Work horses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We gave our promise to clean up the grounds
and we&rsquo;re going to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m tired,&rdquo; Ross said sullenly, flinging himself
on the ground. &ldquo;Besides, it&rsquo;s almost lunch time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can clean your section later,&rdquo; Brad consented.
&ldquo;Just so you get the job done in the next
day or so. By the way, you told Mr. Kain about the
broken window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as Brad fixed him with a disapproving
gaze, Ross added with a flare of temper: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
get a chance to do it. I&rsquo;ll tell him the next time he
comes around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother,&rdquo; Brad replied shortly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him
myself when I see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the sun rose higher, all the Cubs began to look
forward to lunch. Unaccustomed to such heavy
work, they felt the need of a rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, fellows, knock off,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield advised
them. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve put in a big morning. Rest
awhile and then we&rsquo;ll eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan and Brad took advantage of the lull to roam
around the castle. Both boys were fascinated by its
unusual design and old-world appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer about that laughter I heard from the
woods,&rdquo; Dan commented thoughtfully. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen
no one, and yet I&rsquo;m sure someone was watching us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it came from the castle,&rdquo; Brad suggested,
gazing up at the shadowy turrets. &ldquo;With that window
broken, any tramp could get inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about taking another look?&rdquo; Dan proposed.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have time for a quick search through the
house before lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Brad agreed after a slight hesitation.</p>
<p>Unfastening the window latch, the boys climbed
through.</p>
<p>As he straightened up, Dan sniffed the air suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I smell something!&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>Brad also had noticed the odor. &ldquo;Smoke!&rdquo; he
agreed. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s burning! It&rsquo;s inside the castle
too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Thoroughly alarmed, the boys darted from room
to room. Running through a butler&rsquo;s pantry they
came to a huge kitchen with row upon row of
shelves.</p>
<p>At one end of the room was a fireplace. To the
amazement of the boys, a fire had been built there.
A few of the larger sticks still smoldered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone has been in here since we came!&rdquo; Brad
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose one of the Cubs could have
built the fire, Brad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellows all have been working,&rdquo; Brad replied,
deeply puzzled. &ldquo;Besides, everyone heard Mr.
Kain warn about starting fires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan had lowered his voice. &ldquo;This just goes to
prove that I was right,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I did hear
laughter while we were filming the creek scene.
Someone was watching us&mdash;either from the woods
or this castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bird still may be here too, Dan. Let&rsquo;s look
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quietly the boys went from room to room. No
one could be found on the lower floor. Yet as they
climbed the circular staircase to the second floor,
Dan again thought he heard faint laughter from
below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You imagined it, Dan,&rdquo; Brad insisted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, but this house has a dozen and one hiding
places. It would be easy for anyone to keep out
of our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to go through this place at
night,&rdquo; Brad said with a shiver. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s spooky enough
by daytime. The bank will be smart to get that window
fixed and board up the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Decidedly uneasy, the boys tramped from one
bed chamber to another. All the rooms were large
and at least half of them had fireplaces. They found
no further evidence that anyone was in the dwelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever the person was, I think he&rsquo;s taken himself
off by now,&rdquo; Brad said finally. By this time they
had examined every room, including the circular
towers at each corner of the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; Dan agreed in relief. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back
to the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There, the two boys carefully stamped out the
dying embers of the fire.</p>
<p>Then, after again inspecting the lower floor, they
let themselves out through the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope to see Mr. Kain tomorrow,&rdquo; Brad said as
he walked back toward the archery range. &ldquo;That
broken window should be repaired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow&rsquo;s Sunday,&rdquo; Dan reminded him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. Well, I&rsquo;ll make a point of seeing him
Monday then. The window has been broken for a
long while, so I suppose another day won&rsquo;t matter
too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs had spread out their lunch at the base
of a large elm tree. Brad and Dan joined the group
and began to eat their sandwiches. As usual, the
conversation reverted to the archery competition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Pack expects to win a prize for having the
best play, it means we&rsquo;ve got to dig in and work,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield warned the Cubs. &ldquo;Our acting is rough,
and a lot of detail has to be worked out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to mention our archery,&rdquo; added Brad with
a laugh. &ldquo;We can stand plenty of target practice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs finished lunch, rested for a half hour,
and then voted to return to the archery range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, you have a chance to win the part of Robin
Hood,&rdquo; Midge encouraged his friend. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
you get to work and show Ross Langdon you can
beat him a mile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easier said than done. He is good and we both
know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Midge admitted grudgingly. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t
forget he&rsquo;s lazy. He&rsquo;s so certain of winning the part,
I&rsquo;ll bet he doesn&rsquo;t do much practicing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like the part,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;I intend to work
hard to improve my shooting. All the same, I haven&rsquo;t
much hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two Cubs were the first to reach the archery
range and so had their choice of bows.</p>
<p>Dan shot first, placing four of his arrows within
the black of the target. Only two struck the outer
rim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting more accurate every time, Dan!&rdquo;
Midge approved, stepping up to take his turn.</p>
<p>Three of his arrows missed the target completely.
He shot the next three more carefully, managing
to get them on the rim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friar Tuck would blush with shame if he could
see me,&rdquo; Midge laughed ruefully. &ldquo;Wow! Am I
lousy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys trotted down to the target to retrieve
their arrows.</p>
<p>Midge glanced at the very center of the target
face and gasped in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, you made a bull&rsquo;s-eye! Your shaft went
right to the heart of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Dan demanded. &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, look at the arrow!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>Dan saw for himself that an arrow had pierced
the target padding at its very center. The shot was
a perfect one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midge, that couldn&rsquo;t have been my shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it certainly wasn&rsquo;t mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan had examined the arrow carefully after removing
it from the target.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither of us shot it,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;See, it&rsquo;s
larger than those we used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shaft is longer,&rdquo; Midge agreed in awe. &ldquo;Also,
we shot six arrows apiece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine should be in the target, Midge. Instead,
there were ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who shot the tenth one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan had no answer for the question. &ldquo;It must
have been there when we started shooting,&rdquo; he said
slowly. &ldquo;Probably we didn&rsquo;t notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s one of Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s arrows. Or
worse luck&mdash;from Ross&rsquo; bow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could be,&rdquo; Dan agreed as they picked up their
arrows and left the range. &ldquo;All the same, I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His gaze roved toward the surrounding woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wonder what, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that arrow was shot by any of
the Cubs or Mr. Holloway either,&rdquo; he announced
with sudden conviction.</p>
<p>Midge stared at him in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else could have shot it, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the other boy admitted
lamely. He was reluctant to tell Midge about the
fire inside the castle until after he had talked with
Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re keeping something to yourself,&rdquo; Midge
accused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure of a thing,&rdquo; Dan replied, moving off
in search of the Cub leader. &ldquo;I wish though that we
could find the person who shot that arrow! He&rsquo;s a
natural for the role of Robin Hood!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER 5</span>
<br />Competition</h2>
<p>The following Sunday all the Cubs and some of
their parents gathered at the castle grounds to continue
work on the play and movie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s well that the Robin Hood theme was
chosen,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield told the boys as they set up
the archery target. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned that at least twenty
organizations are entering the contest. Furthermore,
about half of them are working on Indian scripts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys had entered into play acting with tremendous
enthusiasm. Everyone craved to have the
Robin Hood role, but it was generally conceded
that it would fall to either Dan or Ross.</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway took several movie shots of the
two Cubs at target practice. He told them that if
they would drop around to his house a few nights
later, all of the films would be run off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will give us an idea of how we&rsquo;re coming
along,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;We have a lot of work ahead
of us before the play can be whipped into shape
for the final filming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield explained to the Cubs that as the
script was being written, a shooting match at Nottingham
would be one of the outstanding scenes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t film this scene until nearly last because
we haven&rsquo;t settled upon who is to be Robin Hood,&rdquo;
he declared. &ldquo;For that reason, it will be necessary
to skip around in the story, shooting a scene whenever
we can. Later on we&rsquo;ll prune out many of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This preliminary work is more or less to get a
line on acting ability,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway added. &ldquo;The
roles are only temporary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What scene will we film first?&rdquo; Midge asked his
father.</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway said he had thought of doing one
in which the sheriff played the leading part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the story,&rdquo; he refreshed the memories
of the boys. &ldquo;At the shooting match in Nottingham,
Robin Hood disguises himself and wins out over
some of the best shots in England. But after tricking
the sheriff, he wishes to let him know that it was he
who had been victorious.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I remember that scene!&rdquo; cried Dan. &ldquo;Robin
Hood sends Little John and Will Stutely into the
town. While the sheriff and his men are at dinner,
they shoot an arrow onto the table. A scroll is attached
to the shaft. The message reveals that it was
Robin Hood who won the shooting match, disguised
as the tattered stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to modify the scene somewhat,&rdquo; Mr.
Holloway said. &ldquo;For one thing, it will be taken outdoors
instead of inside the castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could make it inside,&rdquo; interposed Ross.</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway shook his head. &ldquo;We have no permission
to enter the building,&rdquo; he reminded the
Cub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will we use for a banquet table?&rdquo; inquired
Brad.</p>
<p>The Den Dad told the boys he had noticed a
roadside picnic table and bench along the highway,
which would serve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked permission of the State Highway Dept.
to borrow it for an hour,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We can move it
up here, so we&rsquo;ll have the castle for a background.
Then when the scene is finished, we&rsquo;ll carry it back
again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>Brad, Dan, Chips and Fred Hatfield started off
to get the table and bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming, Ross?&rdquo; Chips asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve got to do something else,&rdquo; he replied
vaguely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; offered Red Suell.</p>
<p>Several of the Den 1 boys also offered their services.
No comment was made on Ross&rsquo; reluctance to
help. Each Cub, however, secretly was annoyed by
the other boy&rsquo;s laziness.</p>
<p>The long wooden table and bench were set up
on the brick terrace in front of the vine-covered
castle wall.</p>
<p>Food and dishes then were brought out from the
picnic hampers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll shoot the scene two or three times, using
different boys in various parts,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield declared.
&ldquo;Brad will act the role of Little John for the
first filming. We&rsquo;ll try Ross out as the sheriff&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m to be Robin Hood,&rdquo; the boy broke in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That hasn&rsquo;t been decided yet,&rdquo; the Cub leader
reminded him. Ignoring Ross&rsquo; scowl, he went on:
&ldquo;Chips will take the part of Will Stutely. The others
will be knights gathered at the festive board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be the sheriff,&rdquo; Ross muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, forget it, will you?&rdquo; Brad demanded, losing
patience. &ldquo;A Cub is supposed to be cooperative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The filming of the scene began. Still grumbling
at the role which had been thrust upon him, Ross
took his place at the head of the picnic table.</p>
<p>As the camera began to grind, Brad, from the
nearby thicket, shot an arrow. His first missed the
table completely. On the second try, however, it
dropped squarely amid the dishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence came this?&rdquo; Ross demanded, speaking
the lines which had been assigned him.</p>
<p>He picked up the arrow, and removing the scroll,
read the message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thou didst give the prize to Robin Hood,&rsquo;&rdquo; he
read aloud. And he added with gruff hostility:
&ldquo;Wait until I lay my hands on that sneaking
coward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut!&rdquo; called Mr. Holloway. &ldquo;Well done, boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs praised Ross, for he had spoken the
lines of the sheriff naturally. Also, his sullen manner
had suited the character perfectly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You make a swell sheriff,&rdquo; Red praised him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah?&rdquo; Ross retorted. &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t think
you&rsquo;re going to unload that role on me! I&rsquo;m going
to be Robin Hood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway filmed a scene with Brad and
Chips as Little John and Will Stutely. He then tried
out several of the Den 1 boys in the part of the
sheriff.</p>
<p>However, everyone agreed that Ross had acted
the role better than anyone else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, you ought to be Robin Hood,&rdquo; Brad told
him as the two rested under a tree. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a natural
for that part, just as Ross is in the role of
sheriff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to make him think so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to Mr. Holloway and Mr. Hatfield to
assign the parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Dan agreed, chewing at a blade of grass,
&ldquo;but it was decided Robin Hood should be played
by the Cub who proves to be the best shot. And we
both know Ross is tops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t been proven yet,&rdquo; Brad insisted. &ldquo;I
noticed while you were practicing a while ago,
you&rsquo;re improving fast, Dan. Ross hasn&rsquo;t touched a
bow all day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working hard,&rdquo; Dan admitted. &ldquo;Honestly
though, I think Ross will win the part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t deserve it with all his boasting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not, but he&rsquo;s handy with a bow. And
that&rsquo;s what counts. Say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan, who was sprawled comfortably on the
ground, suddenly sat up. He gazed steadily toward
the bushes behind the castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; demanded his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, I guess,&rdquo; Dan admitted with a laugh.
&ldquo;For just a minute, I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought what, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I caught a flash of green over there amid
the bushes. I thought I saw someone peeping out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the Cubs probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could have been, only it didn&rsquo;t look like any
of the fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The parents are roaming around the grounds
too,&rdquo; Brad reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Dan admitted, &ldquo;it couldn&rsquo;t have been
anything. All the same, it gave me a start for a second.
I had the feeling someone who shouldn&rsquo;t be
here was watching the filming of our play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ghost of the castle, for instance?&rdquo; Brad
asked, giving him a sidelong glance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quit kidding me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did think you saw someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Dan said soberly. &ldquo;It might have been one
of the Cubs, only I didn&rsquo;t think so. You know, Brad,
I&rsquo;ve had a queer feeling ever since we came here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if someone were watching us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Brad. I know it sounds silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t silly,&rdquo; the older boy replied soberly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
had the same sort of feeling myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose my imagination was stirred by finding
a fire inside the castle,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;And then that
arrow in the target. It never did match any of the
ones we were using.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone is hiding out here all right,&rdquo; Brad admitted
with sudden conviction. &ldquo;Suppose we amble
around and see if we can find anyone. No use worrying
the other Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without attracting attention to themselves, the
two boys walked over to the bushes where Dan had
seen movement.</p>
<p>No one was there. Brad found a few footprints.
There was no way they could tell whether or not
they had been made by one of the Cubs. For, as
Dan pointed out, the boys of Den 1 and 2 had been
everywhere on the grounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be smart not to say anything about this to
the other fellows,&rdquo; Brad advised. &ldquo;No use getting
them excited. Especially as it may not amount to
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep mum,&rdquo; Dan promised. &ldquo;All the same,
I&rsquo;d like to track down our castle ghost. So far, he&rsquo;s
proven as elusive as Robin Hood himself!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER 6</span>
<br />Ghost of the Castle</h2>
<p>The Cubs of Den 2 worked hard the next week
making &ldquo;props&rdquo; for their Robin Hood play. Dan
assisted Mr. Holloway in blocking out scenes for
the movie, and was told he had done an excellent
job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should have a chance to win first prize in the
contest,&rdquo; the Den Dad declared late one afternoon
as the boys met in their clubroom.</p>
<p>The meeting room of Den 2 was the envy of all
the other Cub Scouts in Webster City. Situated
high in a natural cave above the beach, it afforded
a fine view not only of the shoreline, but also the
distant Boy Scout camp on Skeleton Island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the play is rapidly whipping into shape,&rdquo;
declared Sam Hatfield. &ldquo;Right now, our crying need
is for costumes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the mothers were going to help us
out,&rdquo; Dan remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have agreed to,&rdquo; the Cub leader answered.
&ldquo;That is, they&rsquo;ll sew the costumes. However, there&rsquo;s
a little item of buying materials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t each Cub provide his own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to suggest that,&rdquo; nodded Mr. Hatfield.
&ldquo;I feel though, that the money should be
earned by each boy. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to ask the
parents to pay for our costumes&mdash;especially as some
of them will be rather elaborate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cub leader explained to the other boys his
plan and no one raised any objection. Chips and
Red however, were uncertain how they would earn
the necessary money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you might try cutting lawns, gathering
papers, or running errands,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield suggested.
&ldquo;Give it a little thought. I&rsquo;m sure you can come up
with some idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon must we have the money?&rdquo; Midge
asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield said he thought it should be turned
in not later than a week.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The mothers will need the materials to start sewing
the costumes,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Deadline for the
contest is the twenty-fifth of the month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the meeting broke up, Brad and Dan sauntered
down the street together, discussing how they
would earn their money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Dad has been after me to clean the basement,&rdquo;
Brad remarked. &ldquo;Maybe I can get fifty cents
for that job. It will be a start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the odd jobs around our place are cleaned
up,&rdquo; Dan said thoughtfully. &ldquo;It looks as if I&rsquo;ll have
to get out and hustle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That very afternoon, he called on several neighbors,
offering to wash windows or the family car.
In each instance, he was politely but firmly turned
down.</p>
<p>Rather discouraged, Dan then appealed to his
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can think up some job if you give me
a little time,&rdquo; she said to encourage him. &ldquo;Off hand
I can&rsquo;t think of a thing. Usually, you&rsquo;re two or three
jobs ahead of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Dan went to the drugstore at six o&rsquo;clock
to get a newspaper for his father, he met Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you coming on earning money?&rdquo; the boy
asked him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No luck yet,&rdquo; Dan admitted. &ldquo;Jobs seem to be
mighty scarce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ran an errand and picked up a quarter,&rdquo; Fred
told him. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve been able to earn so
far. Red and Chips are having a tough time too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Webster City must suddenly have been hit by a
depression, Fred. I wonder how the Den 1 boys are
getting their costumes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad told me they&rsquo;re earning their money too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope they have better luck than we&rsquo;re
having.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Dan spoke, a voice behind him demanded:
&ldquo;Better luck at what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan and Fred turned around to see Ross Langdon
standing behind them. His bicycle was parked
outside the drugstore. Over his shoulder was slung
a paper carrier&rsquo;s sack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were talking about earning money for our
Robin Hood costumes,&rdquo; Fred explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble with you fellows is you don&rsquo;t have
any hustle and get-up,&rdquo; Ross taunted them. &ldquo;Now
me&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have no difficulty raising any amount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father will give it to you, I bet!&rdquo; Dan said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life. I&rsquo;m earning it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; demanded Dan and Fred together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Ross tapped the canvas case over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken on a paper route,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I
start with eight customers. Probably by the end of
the week, I&rsquo;ll have twenty or thirty. That will give
me a nice profit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite themselves, the other two Cubs were impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you had the route?&rdquo; Fred demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just started. My father got it for me through
a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! You&rsquo;re lucky,&rdquo; Dan said without envy.
&ldquo;Wish I could land one too. Any chance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest,&rdquo; Ross answered loftily. &ldquo;You
have to think up your own ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I guess so,&rdquo; Dan admitted goodnaturedly.
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re all set. Running a paper
route should be profitable, but it will mean hard
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Ross shrugged. &ldquo;On my bike
it shouldn&rsquo;t take long to make deliveries. It&rsquo;s a
cinch! And watch the money roll in. I&rsquo;ll buy myself
a super Robin Hood costume that will knock your
eye out! No home-made affair for me! Not on your
life!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>Having delivered himself of this, Ross smiled in
a superior way and ambled off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if that guy is a Cub, he makes me sick!&rdquo;
Fred muttered when the boy was beyond hearing.
&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t last long at a paper route.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan did not think so either. But he pointed out
Ross probably would stick to the job until he had
acquired enough to buy the Robin Hood costume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s able to buy a good one, and I come up
with a make-shift, that cinches the role for him,
Fred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kid yourself,&rdquo; the other returned. &ldquo;Dad
won&rsquo;t give the part to Ross just because he can dig
up the best costume. He&rsquo;ll have to prove he&rsquo;s the
better actor and archer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan paid for the newspaper and the boys left the
drugstore together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget we&rsquo;re to go to Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s house
tomorrow night,&rdquo; Fred reminded as they parted.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s promised to run off those first movie scenes
we took at the castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there,&rdquo; Dan promised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>The Den Dad had invited all the boys of both
Den 1 and 2 to his home. On the following night
not a single Cub was absent from the meeting, for
all were eager to view the films.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d they turn out, Mr. Holloway?&rdquo; Dan asked
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; the Den Dad replied. &ldquo;In one of the
scenes though&mdash;a mystery has cropped up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mystery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let the boys discover it for themselves,&rdquo; Mr.
Holloway replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see whose eyes are sharp
enough to spot it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deeply puzzled by the Den Dad&rsquo;s remark, the
Cubs plied him with questions. To all he made the
same answer: &ldquo;Wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway had hung up a screen in the downstairs
recreation room. The boys gathered in a semi-circle
in front of it and waited impatiently for the
showing of the film.</p>
<p>The room was darkened. After testing out the
focus, Mr. Holloway ran through the first scene that
had been taken at the creek.</p>
<p>The Cubs howled with laughter as they watched
the duel between Brad and Ross. As the latter tumbled
into the water with a mighty splash, their mirth
could not be controlled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Heck! I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that funny,&rdquo; Ross protested.</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway ran off other scenes in rapid order.
The Cubs remarked that Dan&rsquo;s acting was especially
good and that Brad too had acted his role well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that mystery you were telling us about?&rdquo;
Midge demanded when only one more scene remained
to be shown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see,&rdquo; smiled Mr. Holloway. &ldquo;Watch
sharp now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the room was darkened. Mr. Holloway began
the showing of the banquet scene with the
castle and forest as background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Ross is good as the Sheriff of Nottingham!&rdquo;
exclaimed Midge. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a natural part for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like fun!&rdquo; growled Ross. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m to be Robin
Hood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So engrossed were the boys in watching for themselves
in the scene, that almost before they realized
it, the film had been run off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Holloway. &ldquo;Who caught
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caught what?&rdquo; asked Red in perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice anything,&rdquo; declared Chips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>Dan spoke quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, Mr. Holloway.
The film went so fast. But I thought I did see something
unusual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, you&rsquo;re making that up!&rdquo; challenged Ross.
&ldquo;What did Bunny Bright Eyes see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t in the foreground,&rdquo; Dan said slowly.
&ldquo;Just for an instant, I thought I caught a flash of
a face back in the bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what?&rdquo; demanded Ross, getting up from the
floor. &ldquo;Cubs were all over the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This didn&rsquo;t look like one of our boys. The face
wasn&rsquo;t clear, but I&rsquo;m sure it was no one I&rsquo;d ever
seen before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Ross was on the verge of making another jibe,
Mr. Holloway said quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan is right. The camera lens picked up an extra
character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan and Brad exchanged a glance, as the same
thought occurred to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I didn&rsquo;t imagine that someone was hiding
out in the bushes watching us!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed. &ldquo;It
must have been that crack-shot&mdash;the ghost of the
castle!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER 7</span>
<br />A Mysterious Arrow</h2>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s observation about seeing an extra person in
the background of the film greatly excited the other
Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show the scene again,&rdquo; they begged Mr. Holloway.</p>
<p>The Den Dad re-threaded the film into the projection
machine and ran it through at slow speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Dan, catching
the first glimpse of the unfamiliar face in the scene.</p>
<p>Before he obtained a definite impression of the
person, the figure had ducked back into the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly!&rdquo; exclaimed Red in amazement. &ldquo;Where
did <i>he</i> pop from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t it have been one of the Cubs from
Den 1?&rdquo; demanded Fred.</p>
<p>Dan reminded the boys that during the filming
of the banquet scene all of the Cubs had taken part.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Someone was watching us from the bushes,&rdquo;
Brad confirmed the younger boy&rsquo;s opinion. &ldquo;Too
bad we didn&rsquo;t get a clearer impression of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the request of the Cubs, Mr. Holloway ran
through the film a third time. However, it was impossible
for anyone to identify the stranger in the
scene.</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway, Dan and Brad were of the opinion
that the intruder was another boy. The others
thought he had looked older and might be a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate, we know there&rsquo;s a little substance
to our &lsquo;ghost of the castle,&rsquo;&rdquo; Dan laughed. &ldquo;Maybe
next time we&rsquo;re out there, we can catch him. I don&rsquo;t
like the idea of being spied on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway and Mr. Hatfield devoted some
time to discussing the various scenes of the play
with the boys, pointing out where improvement
could be made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the movie we&rsquo;ll need titles,&rdquo; the Den Dad
explained. &ldquo;Also, it will be necessary to do a great
deal of editing and cutting in the final version.
We&rsquo;ll need a committee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make Dan chairman,&rdquo; suggested Brad. &ldquo;He
knows the Robin Hood story better than anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll appoint Dan, Red and Chips,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway
said. &ldquo;There will be plenty of work to do because
we must start the final filming by next Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which reminds me that we&rsquo;ll have to speed up
the archery contest,&rdquo; added Sam Hatfield. &ldquo;To avoid
argument, the winner of the match shall have the
role of Robin Hood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair enough,&rdquo; grinned Dan.</p>
<p>Aware that costumes for the play would be
needed in a hurry, the boys promised to turn their
money in as quickly as possible so that materials
could be bought.</p>
<p>During the early part of the week, the Cubs of
both Den 1 and 2 canvassed the neighborhoods,
seeking odd jobs.</p>
<p>As Dan already had observed, they were discouragingly
scarce.</p>
<p>Except for Ross Langdon, not a single Cub was
certain of earning the amount needed within a short
period of time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we should have is a project all the boys
can work on together,&rdquo; Brad declared one night as
he and Dan discussed the problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might gather and sell papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The market has collapsed. I&rsquo;ve already investigated
that job possibility.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;At this time of year, all the odd jobs are taken,&rdquo;
Dan said gloomily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so dry, even the lawns
hardly need cutting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Brad agreed. &ldquo;City Council has warned
folks to go easy on using water. The pressure is low.
Every vacant lot with so many dried weeds presents
a hazard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan stared at the older boy, as an idea suddenly
came to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, maybe that&rsquo;s the ticket!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is, Dan? I don&rsquo;t follow you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, maybe the Cubs could get a job from the
city cutting weeds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The city has its own crew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, but not half of the outlying areas have
been mowed. I read in the paper yesterday, the city
is having trouble finding workers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad thought the matter over. &ldquo;We never could
sell our services to the city,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But we might
get individual jobs for the Cubs&mdash;especially from
real estate men who have considerable vacant property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of it near the castle,&rdquo; Dan recalled.
&ldquo;We might be able to round up a few jobs in that
area.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>The two boys discussed the matter with the other
Cubs. Very few of the organization members had
been successful in earning enough money. Everyone
except Ross Langdon immediately favored the project.
Ross declared that to cut weeds would inflame
his nose and bring on an attack of hay fever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I have more than enough money now
for my Robin Hood costume,&rdquo; he said smugly. &ldquo;No
weed cutting for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Brad shrugged. &ldquo;Suit yourself. Don&rsquo;t forget
though, that you have a section of ground at the
castle to clear before next Saturday. We gave our
promise to the bank that it would be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning, Brad and Dan set out to see
how many jobs they could obtain for the Cubs.</p>
<p>After trying four places, they were given the
promise of one small one. With all the Cubs working,
Brad calculated it would not take an hour for
the boys to clean up the premises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need at least another sizeable job to make
it worth while,&rdquo; Dan commented as the two boys
paused for a moment on the highway. &ldquo;But where
will we get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad had noticed a well-kept property directly
ahead on the right-hand side of the road. Orchards
were surrounded by an artistically built wooden rail
fence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>However, tall dried weeds had grown about the
rails. Should a fire start from a dropped match or
cigarette, not only the fence, but the orchard as well
might be damaged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try that place ahead,&rdquo; Brad proposed. &ldquo;We
could grub out those weeds by hand in two or three
hours. It would make the grounds look better and
eliminate a fire hazard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys could not see the house from the main
road.</p>
<p>Seeking it, they followed a winding lane through
attractively laid out grounds. Presently, they
came within view of a large white house with two
pillars supporting the veranda.</p>
<p>In their immediate path was a small one room
shack which evidently served as a gardener&rsquo;s tool
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope someone is home,&rdquo; Dan remarked.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a long, hard walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as he spoke, a short, wiry man in overalls
came out of the gardener&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys want something?&rdquo; he asked, blocking
their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Brad. He explained that he and
Dan were Cub Scouts in search of odd jobs for their
organization.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s nothing here for you,&rdquo; the man answered
briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to talk to the owner of the property,
if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see him. The master doesn&rsquo;t like
visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the owner?&rdquo; inquired Dan curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind. The point is, you&rsquo;ll find no work
here. I attend to all the odd jobs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do fine at keeping the property in order,&rdquo;
declared Brad, his gaze roving over the well-trimmed
shrubs. &ldquo;But we noticed one little thing
you overlooked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you did, eh?&rdquo; Despite Brad&rsquo;s polite manner,
the gardener was growing more and more irritated.</p>
<p>Trying to be as diplomatic as possible, the boys
told of their need to earn money for costumes. They
then mentioned the uncut weeds along the front
fence, stressing the danger of fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have enough to do around here without pulling
those weeds!&rdquo; the man exclaimed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s more,
I won&rsquo;t take it on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where we come in,&rdquo; said Brad. &ldquo;For a
very moderate fee, the Cubs will do a good job of
cleaning them out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; The gardener now was very
angry. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to make me look bad with the
boss. Well, you can&rsquo;t see him! Now get out of here
before I let the dogs loose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have us all wrong,&rdquo; Dan protested. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
not trying to get anyone into trouble. But the work
should be done and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan would have stood his ground, but Brad
pulled him away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Dan,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find another
place. No use stirring up trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling very annoyed at having been so rudely
dismissed, the two boys started away. They rounded
a point in the road which blocked off their view of
the gardener and the tool house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That stupid lug!&rdquo; Brad snorted. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s afraid
we&rsquo;ll make him look bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the boy spoke the words, an object whizzed
through the air. Flying high above his head, it
lodged in a tree at the side of the lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Brad demanded, startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An arrow!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed. &ldquo;Say! Someone is
using us for a target! We&rsquo;d better take cover!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER 8</span>
<br />Expert Shooting</h2>
<p>Rather alarmed, Brad and Dan looked quickly
behind them.</p>
<p>The roadway was clear. Nor could they see anyone
hiding in the bushes. They were certain however,
that the arrow had been shot from that direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a joke, I guess,&rdquo; Brad said a bit unnerved.
&ldquo;Either that, or the gardener is taking this way of
getting even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a moment, the boys went over to the tree
and pulled out the arrow from the tree where it had
lodged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed. &ldquo;This looks like the arrow
that was shot into our target the other day at the
castle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the same size and shape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not far from the castle grounds either,
Brad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. You know, I don&rsquo;t like the idea of anyone
shooting over our heads, Dan. The arrow may
have been aimed high on purpose, but it&rsquo;s a dangerous
trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure is. Do you think the gardener would do
a trick like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly wanted us to leave. We didn&rsquo;t make
any trouble about it though. So I can&rsquo;t see why he&rsquo;d
shoot an arrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if he didn&rsquo;t, he may know who the archer
is,&rdquo; Dan said, slipping the shaft into his pocket.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back to the tool house and ask him point-blank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a free country,&rdquo; Dan argued. &ldquo;No one
has a right to be shooting arrows at us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll ask him,&rdquo; Brad consented. &ldquo;We
are trespassing though, and he&rsquo;s within his rights to
order us off the property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncertain of the reception they might receive,
the two boys rapidly retraced their steps to the tool
house. In walking they kept a sharp watch of the
bushes. Once Dan thought he heard a giggle from
the shadowy woods. But he saw no one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>As the boys reached the tool house, the door suddenly
swung open.</p>
<p>The Cubs again found themselves confronted by
the gardener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back again?&rdquo; he demanded unpleasantly. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
I tell you to get on the move?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We started all right,&rdquo; Brad replied. &ldquo;Then someone
shot at us from behind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean? Shot at you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan produced the arrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that,&rdquo; the gardener shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ve seen an arrow like this before?&rdquo;
Brad inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I have,&rdquo; the man answered unpleasantly.
&ldquo;Then again, maybe I ain&rsquo;t. Now will you get off this
property, or have I got to call the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go, but first we want to know about this
arrow,&rdquo; Dan said stubbornly. &ldquo;Did you shoot it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the gardener retorted. &ldquo;I got other
things to do than shoot arrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you have a son&mdash;&rdquo; Brad began, but the
man interrupted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t have a son,&rdquo; he said. Uneasily the
man glanced toward the veranda where an elderly
looking gentleman had appeared. &ldquo;Now get going,
or I&rsquo;ll call the police! This is your last warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thoroughly disgusted, Brad and Dan moved
away. At the bend in the lane, they glanced back
and saw that the elderly man remained on the porch,
watching them. Evidently he was the owner of the
property, they thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should have appealed to him,&rdquo; Brad said.
&ldquo;For some reason, Old Sourpuss didn&rsquo;t want us to
talk to his employer. Probably he&rsquo;s afraid we&rsquo;ll drop
a word to the master about how he&rsquo;s allowed the
weeds to flourish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Approaching the place where the arrow had been
shot, the boys walked warily. Nothing happened.
Nor did they see anyone hiding amid the bushes.</p>
<p>Safely, Dan and Brad reached the main road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you suppose shot that arrow?&rdquo; Dan
speculated. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it was the gardener, and
he said he has no son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad could not venture a guess. He agreed with
Dan, however, that the arrow appeared to be identical
with the one that had been shot into the target
at the castle grounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>The meeting with the gardener had discouraged
the two boys. After talking it over, they decided to
abandon looking for work that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have one job lined up at any rate,&rdquo; Dan declared.
&ldquo;That will keep the Cubs busy and provide
a little money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following day, the boys of Den 2 joined
forces to clear away the weeds and dry grass at the
Wilkinson estate. So well did they do the work, that
the owner engaged them to clean another larger
area for him.</p>
<p>By the end of the day, the Cubs had netted enough
to buy the materials for their costumes.</p>
<p>All that week Dan spent as much time as he could
on the archery range near his home. He and Midge
practiced too at the Holloway home, with Mr. Holloway
offering expert instruction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve improved remarkably,&rdquo; the Den Dad
praised Dan. &ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t get excited Saturday, and
you may yet win the role of Robin Hood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Saturday, not only the Cubs of both dens but
the parents as well, gathered to witness the shooting
contest.</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway had brought along his movie camera
and planned to record the match.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll run the contest off as much as possible as
it was done at Nottingham Town,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
announced. &ldquo;However, the winner shall have the
role of Robin Hood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Review the scene for us, please,&rdquo; Midge requested
the Cub leader.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield explained that the Sheriff of Nottingham
had planned the shooting contest as a trick to
capture Robin Hood. Because the outlaw was known
never to miss an important match, it was believed
that he would not fail to appear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the sidelines we have the sheriff and his men,&rdquo;
the Cub leader said. &ldquo;When the herald blows a blast,
the archers take their places. How many are to compete
for the role?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only four boys had decided to try for it. Besides
Dan and Ross, Midge and Clyde Jennings, a boy
from Den 1, had finally asked for a chance at the
part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each boy will shoot only six arrows,&rdquo; the Cub
leader instructed. &ldquo;And the one having the highest
total is the winner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clyde Jennings stepped to the line. His first three
arrows missed the target entirely. The final three
barely caught in the outer rim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That finishes me,&rdquo; muttered Clyde, deeply humiliated.
&ldquo;I never did that bad before. Having so
many people watching, made me nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Midge&rsquo;s turn came next. He drew his bow quickly
but did not take as careful aim as he might have
done. The arrow netted him only three points.</p>
<p>On the next five shots Midge used more care. Even
so, he wound up with a total of 20 points.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of it,&rdquo; he whispered to Dan. &ldquo;Unless you
can come through, Ross will be Robin Hood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd became quiet as Ross picked up his
bow. His first two arrows landed squarely in the gold
of the target.</p>
<p>Ross grinned at his own success and winked at
one of the Cubs.</p>
<p>But his next shot was wild, barely catching the
outer rim of the target. On his fourth arrow he recovered
form somewhat, managing to net seven
points.</p>
<p>His total score read: 991753 or six arrows shot for
a total of 34 points.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice going, Ross,&rdquo; praised Dan. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
I can better it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Den 1 boy&rsquo;s response was a proud smile. He
too felt that Dan couldn&rsquo;t beat him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot as well as you can, Dan,&rdquo; Midge whispered
into his ear. &ldquo;Our play will be ruined if Ross is made
Robin Hood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan deftly fitted the feather of the arrow to his
bowstring. Taking aim carefully, he let speed the
shaft. Straight it flew, but missed the target by a
scant inch and nose-dived into a hillock.</p>
<p>The Cubs of Den 2 emitted a loud moan. Ross
smiled broadly. He was confident now of victory.</p>
<p>Outwardly unmoved, Dan again took aim, deliberately
lowering his sight. Again the arrow flew
straight from his bow, landing in the gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine points!&rdquo; shouted Midge, tossing his cap into
the air. &ldquo;Keep &rsquo;er up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan shot twice more in rapid succession. Both
arrows landed in the yellow. The boy now had shot
four times for a total of 27 points.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it again, Dan!&rdquo; yelled Red.</p>
<p>Dan, however, was less sure of himself on the next
shot. The arrow dug into the target on the rim of the
gold.</p>
<p>Lest there be any argument, Mr. Hatfield ruled
that it had fallen within the next band of color. Dan
was awarded 7 points.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That ties the score!&rdquo; whooped Midge. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
win easily now, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words unnerved Dan. As he raised his bow
to make the final shot, he could feel his arm tremble.
When he finally released the arrow, it missed the
target.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buck fever,&rdquo; Dan laughed, putting down his
bow. &ldquo;I guess I deserve to lose out to Ross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield informed him.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re both tied with 34 points. Now you&rsquo;ll have to
shoot again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ross had jumped up from the grass. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
to do that,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;My arm is sore. I hit the
target every time while Dan missed twice. Doesn&rsquo;t
that prove&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;Well, Ross, if
you&rsquo;re unwilling to shoot again, suppose we settle
it by drawing lots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; the boy agreed after hesitating a moment.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty lucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about you, Dan? Are you willing to settle
it by drawing cuts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair enough,&rdquo; Dan agreed. &ldquo;For that matter,
I&rsquo;m willing to give the part to Ross. Honestly, I
feel he&rsquo;s the better shot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ross will make an excellent Sheriff of Nottingham,&rdquo;
returned Mr. Hatfield, preparing several strips
of paper for the &ldquo;draw.&rdquo; &ldquo;So we&rsquo;ll decide the matter
by lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cub leader told the boys that the one who
received the shorter stub of paper should be declared
winner.</p>
<p>Ross took his turn first. After studying the slips
which Mr. Hatfield held half-concealed in his hand,
he finally drew one forth.</p>
<p>In length, it appeared fairly short.</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s turn came next. Thinking that Ross already
had won, he selected a slip carelessly. To his astonishment,
it was a stub end&mdash;at least two inches
shorter than the paper the other boy had drawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan wins!&rdquo; cried Chips gleefully.</p>
<p>Ross was too crestfallen to speak. He started to
say that the contest hadn&rsquo;t been fair, but choked off
the words. After all, he had protested at shooting a
second time, and had favored drawing lots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Ross,&rdquo; Dan said, noticing the other&rsquo;s
keen disappointment. &ldquo;If it means so much to you,
keep the role.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ross shook his head and tried to grin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, you won the part and it&rsquo;s yours for good,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well spoken, Ross,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield, clapping
him on the back. &ldquo;A Cub has to be a good sport
about losing out. You&rsquo;ll be an asset to the play as the
Sheriff of Nottingham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; Ross murmured, smiling weakly.</p>
<p>The Cubs started toward the target, intending to
retrieve their arrows.</p>
<p>Before they could cross the range, three arrows
were shot in rapid succession over their heads. Each
lodged in almost the center of the target.</p>
<p>Amazed, the boys whirled around. The archer who
had sent the arrows winging had drawn his bow
from a long distance away. But he was nowhere in
sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who shot those arrows?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield demanded.
&ldquo;That was real shooting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they came from that clump of bushes to
the right!&rdquo; Brad exclaimed. &ldquo;It must be that mysterious
fellow who&rsquo;s always taking shots over our
heads. Let&rsquo;s nab him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus urged, the Cubs made a dash for the clump
of foliage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER 9</span>
<br />A Neglected Duty</h2>
<p>Surrounding the area from which the arrows
had been shot, the Cubs closed in.</p>
<p>But, after whipping through the bushes, they
were unable to find the mysterious archer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow knew we would be after him,&rdquo; Brad
remarked, carefully looking about on the ground for
telltale clues. &ldquo;He must have run off the moment he
shot the arrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s good too,&rdquo; spoke up Ross. &ldquo;Better than our
champion, Dan Carter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the Den 1 boy&rsquo;s tone, it was evident that
he still smarted under loss of the star role in the
play. Dan, however, refused to be annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a lot better shot than I am,&rdquo; he agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to find him and let him take the part,&rdquo;
Ross went on, determined to make the Den 2 boy
feel uncomfortable. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d show us some real shooting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could trail him,&rdquo; Dan replied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d
be an asset to our play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be a youngster too,&rdquo; added Brad, pointing
to several footprints he had found beside a
bush. &ldquo;See, his shoe is shorter than mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cluster of footprints appeared in a tiny clearing
which gave an unobstructed view of the target.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have stood here when he shot those
three arrows,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;The question is, which
way did he go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the Cubs were for combing the entire
wooded section. However, Mr. Hatfield, who had
followed the boys, advised against such action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The person easily could elude us, for apparently
he knows the trails well,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Furthermore,
we have work to do. Now that Dan definitely
has been chosen as Robin Hood, we must begin to
whip our play into shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the other roles?&rdquo; asked Midge. &ldquo;Who
is to be the Sheriff of Nottingham?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve decided to give that role to Ross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; Ross muttered. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I be
Allan-a-Dale?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not ready for the scenes in which that
character appears,&rdquo; the Cub leader explained
patiently. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make a fine sheriff. Besides, Mr.
Holloway tells me we&rsquo;ll be able to refilm the banquet
scene with no change except the addition of costumes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fine!&rdquo; Ross grumbled.</p>
<p>Returning to the clearing, all the Cubs worked
hard for the next hour and a half. As the archery
contest had been the main attraction, many of the
parents began to drift away.</p>
<p>By mid-afternoon, only the Cubs and a few of
their fathers remained. The boys were reacting a
scene which had given them trouble, when Red
called attention to a car that had driven into the
grounds from the main road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that looks like Mr. Kain,&rdquo; Dan remarked.
&ldquo;I guess he drove out to see what we&rsquo;re doing here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He probably wants to make certain we aren&rsquo;t
doing any damage,&rdquo; added Red.</p>
<p>Mr. Kain alighted from his car and sauntered over
to the group. After speaking to several of the boys,
he asked for Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went off somewhere for a minute,&rdquo; Brad replied.
&ldquo;Anything we can do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I merely drove out to see that everything
was under control here,&rdquo; the bank employee answered.
&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve cleared away this area in front
of the castle very efficiently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; agreed Brad, pleased by the praise.
&ldquo;A Cub always keeps a promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look around a bit. Don&rsquo;t mind me, boys. Go
on with whatever you were doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Kain wandered off in the general direction of
the castle and vanished from view. Belatedly, it
occurred to Brad that he had neglected to tell the
bank man about the broken window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it before he leaves,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>The scene upon which the Cubs were working
finally was finished. Satisfied with the filming, Mr.
Holloway told the boys to snatch a brief rest.</p>
<p>Brad took advantage of this period to go in search
of Mr. Kain. The man had been gone so long that
the boy wondered what had detained him.</p>
<p>As he rounded a corner of the vine-covered castle,
he came upon the bank employee. Mr. Kain was
gazing at the broken window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he remarked, seeing Brad. &ldquo;When we gave
the Cub Scouts permission to use this property, we
assumed they would exercise care.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We did, too,&rdquo; replied Brad, ready to defend the
organization. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re referring to that broken window,
we didn&rsquo;t smash it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No? I don&rsquo;t recall seeing that it was broken when
I inspected the premises a few days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was though,&rdquo; Brad assured him. &ldquo;I meant to
tell you about it, but forgot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; Mr. Kain spoke coldly. &ldquo;It seems the
Cubs forget quite a few things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the truth, we didn&rsquo;t smash the window. When we
first came here, we found it broken. Vines covered
the panes, so it wasn&rsquo;t noticed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since then, the Cubs have been going in and out
whenever they felt like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we did roam around a bit inside,&rdquo; Brad
admitted. &ldquo;But no harm was done. I&rsquo;m sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that the window is repaired. However,
there are other matters that concern me. Your failure
to keep a promise, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad was dumbfounded. &ldquo;My promise?&rdquo; he
echoed. &ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, Mr.
Kain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A promise was given me that if I allowed the
Cub Scouts to use this property, all the dead brush
would be cleared away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did the job too,&rdquo; Brad said indignantly. &ldquo;You
said yourself we worked very efficiently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did as far as clearing space for an archery
range. I&rsquo;ll admit that the grounds look very well out
front where they show. But the area behind the
castle hasn&rsquo;t been touched. And the fire hazard is
greater there than elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought all the work had been done,&rdquo;
Brad said in dismay. &ldquo;Show me the place you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Kain led the Den Chief to the section of the
estate which had been assigned to Ross to clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder you&rsquo;re annoyed, Mr. Kain,&rdquo; Brad
said as he viewed the untouched accumulation of
brush. &ldquo;This area was assigned to one of the boys
from Den 1. I thought the work had been done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless the Cubs keep their promises, I can&rsquo;t
allow them to continue to use the grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The work will be done no later than tomorrow,&rdquo;
Brad promised grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Den Chief&rsquo;s straightforward manner impressed
the bank employee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, satisfied by the promise.
&ldquo;The Cubs may continue to use the grounds here,
provided the work is done by tomorrow night. If
not, I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll have to put my foot down. The
truth is, some of the bank officials aren&rsquo;t much in
favor of the Cubs roaming around here. If any damage
should be done, we&rsquo;ll have to ask you to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take precautions,&rdquo; Brad promised again.</p>
<p>Mr. Kain did not wait to see Mr. Hatfield, but
went directly to his car. As he bade Brad good-bye,
however, he warned once more that he would be
back within a day or two to make another inspection.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the car driven away than Dan sought
his friend to learn what was wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty!&rdquo; Brad snapped. &ldquo;That lazy Ross Langdon
really has fouled us up this time! We&rsquo;re apt to get
bounced from here, and all because he didn&rsquo;t attend
to the work assigned him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly, if we had to leave here with only part of
our play filmed, we&rsquo;d be sunk,&rdquo; Dan murmured.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s put the bee on Ross right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys sought the Den 1 Cub, who at the
moment was being measured for his sheriff&rsquo;s costume.
His paper route had provided a substantial
sum for the purchase of materials which Mrs. Holloway
had offered to sew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>Ross, however, could not make up his mind
whether he wanted a home-made costume or one he
might purchase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could make you a very nice outfit,&rdquo;
Mrs. Holloway told the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a jerkin and seagreen hose,&rdquo; Ross declared.
&ldquo;Also a cap with a feather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we should omit the feather?&rdquo;
Mrs. Holloway suggested. &ldquo;After all, it won&rsquo;t do for
you to look too much like Robin Hood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I want a feather,&rdquo; Ross argued. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
I have it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Mrs. Holloway could answer, Brad and
Dan came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the fitting is over, we want to see you a minute,&rdquo;
Brad said to the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; he demanded suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll find out,&rdquo; Brad said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Holloway, whose patience had been worn
by Ross&rsquo; insistent demands, declared that she had
finished taking measurements. Rather reluctantly,
the Den 1 boy followed Brad and Dan across the
clearing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where you taking me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just come along,&rdquo; Brad returned shortly.</p>
<p>As the boys rounded the castle, Ross began to
catch on to what was in store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re going to rag me about not getting the
brush cleaned up,&rdquo; he guessed. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve been too
busy with my paper route. Three customers kicked
yesterday because their papers were delivered late.
I&rsquo;ve no time to be doing grubby work out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest of us have work too,&rdquo; Brad retorted.
&ldquo;By not doing what you were supposed to, you got
us in bad with Mr. Kain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless the brush is cleared away by tomorrow
night, the Cubs stand to lose the use of this property,&rdquo;
Dan added severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that be too bad?&rdquo; Ross drawled. &ldquo;Then
you wouldn&rsquo;t get the role of Robin Hood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad whirled around to glare at the Den 1 boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re acting like a spoiled brat, Ross!&rdquo; he said
curtly. &ldquo;You promised to clear your section of land
and you&rsquo;re going to do it or get out of the Pack! We
don&rsquo;t want a Cub who doesn&rsquo;t do his part or keep a
promise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>The words shocked Ross. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t kick me
out&mdash;&rdquo; he stammered, and then with more confidence,
he added: &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t anyhow! You haven&rsquo;t the
authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until Mr. Hatfield hears about this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re a tattler, Brad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; the Den Chief replied hotly. &ldquo;I
just want to bring you to a realization of your responsibility
to the organization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, you&rsquo;re taking it too seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a serious matter if we lose this site after
all the work we&rsquo;ve done here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, keep your shirt on!&rdquo; Ross retorted. Angrily,
he turned and started away from the two boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re refusing to do the work?&rdquo; Brad called
after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said I was?&rdquo; Ross flung over his shoulder.
&ldquo;It will be done. Just don&rsquo;t rush me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER 10</span>
<br />Checking Up on Ross</h2>
<p>Ross&rsquo; exasperating reply left Dan and Brad as much
in doubt as ever.</p>
<p>Was the Den 1 boy merely putting them aside, or
did he intend to do the work assigned to him?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s report him to Mr. Hatfield,&rdquo; Dan proposed.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s stalling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad was unwilling to trouble the Cub leader
about the matter unless he found it impossible to
reason with Ross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he intends to clean up the brush,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;He only wants to keep us uneasy about it and
guessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we do the job ourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because that&rsquo;s exactly what Ross is hoping we&rsquo;ll
do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so, Brad. But we gave our word to
Mr. Kain the work would be done. I&rsquo;d rather let
Ross have the laugh on us than break a promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I, Dan. But I have a hunch Ross is only
playing possum on us. Tell you what! Let&rsquo;s let the
matter go until tomorrow. If he hasn&rsquo;t done the job
by then, we&rsquo;ll do it ourselves and report him to Mr.
Hatfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me, only I&rsquo;m in favor of reporting him right
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could,&rdquo; the Den Chief agreed reluctantly. &ldquo;It
seems a little like tattling though. Also, if Mr. Hatfield
finds out how Ross has acted, he might ask him
to resign from the Cubs. That would be tough on
him. Ross wants to stay in the organization, even if
he does do a lot of crabbing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, give him another chance,&rdquo; Dan consented.
&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a bad sort except for being lazy and conceited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys agreed to meet the next afternoon at
2 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> at Brad&rsquo;s home. If unable to catch a ride they
would hike to the Castle grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t take the two of us more than three
hours to clean up the section, if Ross fails to do it,&rdquo;
Dan declared. &ldquo;Suppose we&rsquo;ll run into the Ghost of
the Castle?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that reminds me! I want to compare those
arrows that were shot into the target today with the
one we picked up at the gardener&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I already have, Brad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they match?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same person who shot at the target today
must have hidden out in the woods at that other
estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place isn&rsquo;t far from here,&rdquo; Brad remarked,
gazing thoughtfully toward the woods. &ldquo;I wish we
could find out who is spying on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know a couple of things about him,&rdquo; Dan
said with a laugh. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a dandy shot with the longbow,
and besides, he&rsquo;s something of a show-off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently the two boys rejoined the other Cubs.
Ross, they learned, had complained that he was
tired, and had caught a ride into Webster City.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired, my right eye!&rdquo; Dan snorted. &ldquo;He was
afraid we would nail him on that job, and wasn&rsquo;t
taking any chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the day of their encounter with the unfriendly
gardener, Brad had sought without success
to learn who owned the estate. Reminded of his lack
of information, the boy made inquiry of Mr. Holloway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did hear who is living there,&rdquo; the Den Dad
said, trying to recollect. &ldquo;The place is rented, I believe,
to a retired army colonel. Someone told me
he is seriously ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t recall his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t think of it now, Brad. It may come to me
later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if the owner has any children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I heard of, Brad. But then, I never had
any particular interest. Anything on your mind,
Brad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I was merely curious about our neighbors.
I&rsquo;ve been wondering too, who that mysterious archer
may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever he is, he&rsquo;s an expert with the bow,&rdquo;
Mr. Holloway declared. &ldquo;I wish we could catch him
though. Accurate as he is, he shouldn&rsquo;t be shooting
whenever the urge strikes him. He might hit someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently the Cubs brought their day&rsquo;s rehearsal
to a close. Mr. Holloway told the boys he would develop
the films and have them ready for a showing
by the following night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting along well,&rdquo; he praised the Cubs.
&ldquo;I hear though, that some of the organizations competing
for the prize are spending considerable on
scenery and costumes. So we&rsquo;ll have to work hard if
we hope to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning Dan and Brad spent several
hours working with Mr. Hatfield to improve the
script for their play. That job completed, they went
to their separate homes for lunch and then met again
at Brad&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>By this hour the weather had turned very sultry,
but with no indication of rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a hot, dusty walk out to the
Castle,&rdquo; Brad remarked as he and Dan set off down
the highway. &ldquo;I thought maybe Dad would drive us
out, but he had some other work to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst will be if we get out there and discover
Ross hasn&rsquo;t cleaned up the brush,&rdquo; Dan added.</p>
<p>Fearing the worst, both boys had equipped themselves
with large rakes and cutting tools. The articles
were cumbersome to carry. Before they had covered
three-quarters of the distance, both Brad and Dan
were covered with perspiration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This day is a scorcher,&rdquo; Dan declared, mopping
his forehead. &ldquo;The paper this morning warned
householders to go easy on using water. The shortage
is acute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad had spied a roadside stand a short distance
ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll treat you to a bottle of pop,&rdquo; he invited. &ldquo;That
will revive us so we can get to the Castle without
wilting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can sure use a little moisture,&rdquo; Dan accepted
readily. &ldquo;Lead me to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A woman in blue gingham operated the stand,
selling vegetables and a few soft drinks.</p>
<p>The boys bought and paid for their pop, sipping
the cool liquid slowly. A friendly individual, the
woman asked them about the Cub Scout organization,
its aims and purpose.</p>
<p>Brad politely explained that Den 1 and Den 2
were included in a larger classification known as the
Pack. Cub advancement, he pointed out, was based
upon the completion of a set of achievements.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When a boy finishes Wolf requirements, he is
awarded the Wolf Cub rank and badge,&rdquo; Dan carried
on the explanation. &ldquo;As soon as a Wolf Cub is
ten years old, he works to complete the Bear Cub
achievements. Upon reaching his eleventh birthday
and after being a Bear, he may become a Lion
Cub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Lion?&rdquo; inquired the operator of the
stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Bear,&rdquo; Dan corrected. &ldquo;Brad, though, is a Boy
Scout as well as Den Chief. He keeps the younger
boys in line for Mr. Hatfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try, you mean,&rdquo; laughed Brad. &ldquo;As far as one
Cub is concerned, I&rsquo;ve not been very successful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning Ross,&rdquo; grinned Dan. &ldquo;Well, keep trying.
You may soften him up in the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he hasn&rsquo;t done his work out at the Castle, I&rsquo;m
going to adopt drastic methods,&rdquo; Brad threatened.
&ldquo;Finished your drink, Dan? Let&rsquo;s move along before
it gets any hotter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cool drinks scarcely quenched the thirst of the
two boys. Before they had walked another quarter
of a mile, they were as miserable as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No drinking water at the Castle either,&rdquo; Dan remarked.
&ldquo;We should have brought our canteens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys passed a farmhouse and rounded a hill.
From the summit, they were afforded a clear view of
the wooded castle area.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>The stone building with its many odd-shaped
towers and turrets appeared as a dark blot against
the sky. Behind it, the horizon seemed misty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, is that haze or smoke?&rdquo; Brad demanded,
halting on the brow of the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s smoke!&rdquo; exclaimed Dan. &ldquo;And it seems to be
coming from the woods directly behind the Castle!
Maybe Ross is out there burning up the trash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he is, the fire has gone out of control!&rdquo; Brad
cried in alarm. &ldquo;Come on, Dan! We&rsquo;ve got to get
there quick!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER 11</span>
<br />Fire</h2>
<p>The two boys dashed down the hill, climbed a
fence, and raced across a cleared field toward the
castle property.</p>
<p>As they ran, they were increasingly alarmed to
observe that the column of smoke rapidly was growing
blacker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming from directly behind the Castle!&rdquo;
Brad cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the area where Ross was supposed to clean
up the brush,&rdquo; Dan panted, hard at his heels. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t think he was crazy enough to try to burn the
stuff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Brad returned, leaping over a
small ditch. &ldquo;Everything is so dry, it will be hard to
stop a fire once it gets any sort of start.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>The boys were dismayed as they drew closer to
see that the Castle was enveloped in a wispy smoke
which seeped out from the woods.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a light breeze was blowing toward
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Castle will be sure to go unless that fire can
be checked fast!&rdquo; Brad gasped.</p>
<p>The boys now were close enough to be certain
that the smoke did not come from a brush pile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, we&rsquo;ve got to work fast!&rdquo; the older boy
directed, halting abruptly. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do anything
here alone and without equipment. We&rsquo;ve got to call
a fire department.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The city engine won&rsquo;t come this far out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then call Mr. Hatfield and Burton Holloway!
Have them round up the cubs, and bring all the
equipment they can muster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nearest phone must be at that farmhouse
we passed,&rdquo; Dan recalled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get there as fast as
I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad ran on alone toward the Castle. As yet he
could see no flames, but the air was acrid with
fumes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ross!&rdquo; he shouted, thinking that the Den 1 boy
might be somewhere in the woods. &ldquo;Ross Langdon!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>His call went unanswered. But now Brad distinctly
could hear the crackle of flames.</p>
<p>Following a path which led from the rear of the
stone building into the woods, he found the smoke
thicker.</p>
<p>Then ahead, he saw a fiery, uneven line of flame.</p>
<p>Dried grass and leaves had ignited. The flames already
covered an area nearly twenty feet across
and were spreading rapidly.</p>
<p>Tongues of fire licked greedily at the bases of the
trees, but so far had not eaten deeply into the wood.</p>
<p>The smoke and heat halted Brad. He realized his
utter helplessness.</p>
<p>No water was available. He had no tools or anything
with which to fight the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to do something!&rdquo; he thought desperately.
&ldquo;But what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad moved back into the cleared area by the
Castle. The grass was green here and free of brush
and leaves. If the fire could be checked at the edge
of the woods, the building would be spared.</p>
<p>On the other hand, should the tall trees catch,
nothing could stop the fire until it had done untold
damage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>Sparks borne by the wind now were flying toward
the stone dwelling. One fell into a tiny pocket of
leaves and began to blaze.</p>
<p>Brad pounded out the flames and scattered the
leaves with his rake. But other sparks were beginning
to drop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Castle will go unless I can get help fast!&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;May be someone at the adjoining
estate has some equipment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad started at a run across the cleared space and
then on into a field of stubble.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly he tripped over a pile of boards and
fell flat on the ground. His extended hand groping
over the top of the boards, encountered only yawning
space.</p>
<p>Scrambling to his feet, Brad saw that the fall had
saved him from a much worse disaster. The loose
boards only half-covered a deep pit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! That was a narrow escape!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;I could have tumbled in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad gave a quick glance down into the pit and
then did a double take. Water!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old well!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Now if only we
had buckets&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>The boy started on, running toward the estate
where he and Dan so rudely had been dismissed by
the gardener.</p>
<p>Reaching the road, he was just turning into the
lane when a truck halted beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, buddy, where&rsquo;s the fire?&rdquo; the driver asked
him.</p>
<p>Brad saw that it was a telephone company truck
bearing five or six linesmen in addition to the man at
the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a brush fire over behind that stone
house,&rdquo; he informed, pointing toward the area of
billowing smoke. &ldquo;I need help and I need it fast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hop in!&rdquo; directed the driver.</p>
<p>The truck roared down the road and turned in at
the castle grounds. Smoke now was so dense that the
building scarcely was visible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never get it stopped now!&rdquo; Brad cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we will,&rdquo; the truck driver encouraged him.
&ldquo;A trench may be the ticket. We&rsquo;ve got a couple of
spades somewhere in the truck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if those trees get a good start, the entire
forest area will go,&rdquo; Brad pointed out. &ldquo;Those estates
farther down the road will be in danger too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>Piling out of the truck, the linesmen ran to the
scene of the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The smoke is heavy, but the fire hasn&rsquo;t spread too
far&mdash;yet,&rdquo; the truck driver appraised the situation.
&ldquo;The flames are thin and could be beaten out with
blankets&mdash;if we had &rsquo;em. Or water&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad told him about the well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine, but we have only one bucket in the truck.
That will be about as much use as spraying with an
atomizer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the telephone men were getting what equipment
they had from the truck, Dan Carter came
running up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get hold of Mr. Hatfield?&rdquo; Brad demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and Mr. Holloway too. They&rsquo;ll be out here
pronto with all the equipment they can get on short
order. But it looks pretty hopeless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so,&rdquo; Brad mumbled. &ldquo;Oh, it makes me
sick to stand helplessly by and see the Castle destroyed.
We may get the blame too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The linesmen, having no blankets, had made use
of a heavy canvas carried in the truck to protect
equipment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>With it, they beat at the flames which were moving
steadily closer to the stone building. Seeking to
add their bit, Dan and Brad took turns carrying
water from the well.</p>
<p>The pit was shallow. By attaching a rope to the
bucket handle they could lower and dip the container.
The work, however, was slow and discouraging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need a dozen buckets to make any progress,&rdquo;
Dan declared, thoroughly disheartened. &ldquo;Brad, it&rsquo;s
no use!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is!&rdquo; the older boy encouraged him. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
that a car coming this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s automobile!&rdquo; Dan
agreed, straightening up. &ldquo;Oh, I hope he brought
buckets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys ran to meet the car. Mr. Hatfield and a
neighbor sprang out, and began to unload fire extinguishers.
Chips and Red piled out of the back
seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeepers!&rdquo; the latter exclaimed. &ldquo;How did that
start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without answering, Brad demanded if the fire
fighters had brought buckets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find several in the rear compartment of
the car,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield instructed him. &ldquo;Some spades,
old blankets and everything I could get on short
order. Mr. Holloway is following with more helpers
and equipment. Without water though, there&rsquo;s not
much we can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found a well,&rdquo; Brad told him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know how long the water will last though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield and his neighbor seized fire extinguishers
and joined the toiling linesmen. He ordered
the Cubs, directed by Brad, to carry water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t get too close to the fire,&rdquo; he warned.
&ldquo;Your job is just to keep those buckets moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the additional supply of buckets, and other
Cubs to help, Brad and Dan were able to keep a
fairly steady flow of water in the hands of the fire
fighters.</p>
<p>The smoke remained dense. But as Dan carried
his fifth bucket of water, he noticed that the fire line
among the trees had receded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re making a little progress,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
exclaimed jubilantly. &ldquo;If the water only holds out
we may win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an endeavor to prevent the fire from spreading
toward the Castle, the men had dug a narrow, wide
trench.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>As Brad earlier had noted, the fire, though widespread,
had so far fed itself only on dry grass and
brush. The fighters became increasingly hopeful
that it could be put out before the trees ignited.</p>
<p>Within ten minutes Mr. Holloway arrived, bringing
more equipment and extra helpers. In addition
to two men, Midge and Ross Langdon were with
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly!&rdquo; the latter exclaimed as he saw the black
smoke. &ldquo;Look at &rsquo;er burn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remark infuriated Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whose fault is it?&rdquo; he demanded, wiping a
smudge off his cheek. &ldquo;If you had cleaned away the
brush the way you were supposed to, the fire
wouldn&rsquo;t have spread so fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did clean it up,&rdquo; Ross said defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All by yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All by myself,&rdquo; Ross repeated. &ldquo;I worked nearly
two hours and half killed myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan allowed the matter to pass. Ross might be
telling the truth. Since he claimed to have worked
alone, no one could prove or disprove his assertion.
In any case, it didn&rsquo;t much matter now, for the damage
had been done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Grab a bucket, and get to work!&rdquo; he advised.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be nip and tuck to check that fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For once, Ross made no protest at being asked to
work. He seized the bucket and ran back with Dan
to the old well.</p>
<p>Brad had just raised another bucketful which was
only a little over half-filled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water level is going down fast,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;ll have enough to see this thing
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fire&rsquo;s almost licked,&rdquo; Dan encouraged the
others. &ldquo;More help is coming too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smoke had drawn a number of motorists and
nearby residents to the scene. Many of the curious
had remained to help.</p>
<p>The Cubs carried water until they no longer
could get enough out of the well to make it worth
while. But by that time, the fire definitely was under
control. Beating at the flames with blankets and
canvas, the men finally were able to extinguish the
last spark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield exclaimed, sinking
down on the grass to rest. &ldquo;Dan, if that fire had had
another ten minutes start, we never could have
saved the Castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how it started?&rdquo; the boy remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was asking myself. I hope&mdash;&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield did not finish what he had intended to say.</p>
<p>Dan, however, guessed at his thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hope it wasn&rsquo;t one of the Cubs,&rdquo; he completed
with a questioning inflection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I started to say that, Dan. Then I realized that
the remark would be unfair. None of the Cubs were
out here today until you and Brad spotted the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so far as I know,&rdquo; Dan agreed. &ldquo;Last night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time it was the boy who did not finish his
sentence. It struck him that it would be very disloyal
even to hint that Ross might have been responsible
for the fire. Certainly he had no proof that the Den 1
boy had been careless in clearing away brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve saved the Castle and we can be
proud of ourselves,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield declared, getting
up from the ground. &ldquo;The Cubs really pitched in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad and Dan asked the Cub leader how much
damage had been done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to tell,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield replied. &ldquo;Some of
the shrubs have been killed. But I don&rsquo;t believe
many of the trees have been damaged. As soon as
the smoke clears a little, we&rsquo;ll make a thorough
check.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad had noticed a familiar automobile driving
into the grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a little help too,&rdquo; he muttered uncomfortably.
&ldquo;See who&rsquo;s here now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan and Mr. Hatfield turned around to see that
it was Mr. Kain, the bank employee, who had
arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; Dan remarked under his breath, as the
man came swiftly toward them. &ldquo;His face is as black
as the smudge on mine! Something tells me we&rsquo;re
in for it now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER 12</span>
<br />A Debt to Pay</h2>
<p>Mr. Kain strode directly to Mr. Hatfield and the
two cubs. The angry expression on his face left no
doubt as to his attitude about the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have known something like this would
occur!&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Boys never should be permitted
to run wild in a wooded area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute, Mr. Kain,&rdquo; interposed the Cub
leader wearily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jump to hasty conclusions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bank property has been damaged. We happen
to own the woods, you know. It was a mistake to
allow your organization to use this land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re assuming that the Cubs started the fire,
Mr. Kain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else should I think? They&rsquo;ve been here
almost daily, having picnics and starting fires.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t true, Mr. Kain,&rdquo; Brad interposed, losing
patience. &ldquo;The Cubs have been careful about
fires, knowing how dry the woods are at this time of
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve eaten cold food,&rdquo; Dan added. &ldquo;When this
fire started, not a Cub was near the place so far as
I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys were righteously angry for they
felt that the bank employee was unjustly blaming
the Cub organization without having made any investigation
of the facts.</p>
<p>Several of the fire fighters who had overheard
the remark, were of the same opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; spoke up one of the telephone
linesmen. &ldquo;Fact is, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for these two
boys, the fire never could have been stopped. The
house would have been destroyed for sure. But
they saw smoke and got help before the fire was too
well started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This information softened Mr. Kain somewhat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the fire out?&rdquo; he demanded gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practically so,&rdquo; he was informed. &ldquo;The leaves are
smoldering in a few places. But there&rsquo;s no danger,
if the area is watched for awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be glad to do it,&rdquo; offered Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>Mr. Kain made no reply. Abruptly leaving the
group, he went to inspect the smoking, blackened
patch of burned-over ground.</p>
<p>Brad, Dan and the other Cubs watched him uneasily.
From his manner it was impossible to tell
whether or not he accepted their statement that the
Cubs had not been responsible for the fire.</p>
<p>Their eyes red and smarting from the smoke, too
tired to care much what the bank employee thought,
they flung themselves onto the grass to rest.</p>
<p>Mr. Kain presently returned. Immediately it was
evident to the Cubs that his anger remained with
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he picked up?&rdquo; Dan muttered, noticing
a charred object in the man&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a stick,&rdquo; Brad replied.</p>
<p>The object proved to be a half-burned shaft and
arrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may or may not have significance,&rdquo; Mr. Kain
said coldly, addressing the group. &ldquo;I picked it up in
the burned area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like too large an arrow to be one of ours,&rdquo;
said Dan defensively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been using bows and arrows here however?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; admitted Brad. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t been starting
fires with &rsquo;em though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, the arrow convinces me that the
Cubs have been roving through the woods at will,
undoubtedly lighting matches and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cubs are taught to be careful about fire,&rdquo; Brad
broke in. &ldquo;Besides, we&rsquo;ve told you&mdash;the Cubs weren&rsquo;t
here today. Dan and I were the first to arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fire may have been slow in starting&mdash;possibly
it smoldered for hours. But that&rsquo;s neither here nor
there. The damage has been done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re mighty sorry, sir,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t our
fault, and we did our best to check the fire quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m grateful to you for that, boys. All the same,
you see my position. I am responsible to the bank.
Of course you understand that I can&rsquo;t permit you
to continue to use this property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs gazed at Mr. Kain, dumbfounded. It
seemed utterly impossible that he would send them
away after they had worked so hard to save the
Castle.</p>
<p>For a long moment no one spoke. Then Dan said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Kain, do you mean we can&rsquo;t finish the filming
of our play here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>The bank employee dropped the charred arrow
onto the grass. He stirred uneasily under the steady,
almost accusing gaze of the Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it will inconvenience you,&rdquo; he said flatly.
&ldquo;But I have to think of the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inconvenience us!&rdquo; Chips fairly shouted, breaking
into the conversation. &ldquo;If we have to go to another
place, it means filming all the scenes over
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re already working against a deadline,&rdquo; Red
added angrily. &ldquo;Have a heart, Mr. Kain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, boys. Is Mr. Holloway or your Cub leader
around? I&rsquo;ll have to inform them that the organization
is not to come here again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Mr. Hatfield and Mr. Holloway had gone to
one of the cars where equipment was being packed.
Seeing the two men, Mr. Kain would have started
off to intercept them, had not Brad stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute, Mr. Kain,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t feel that you&rsquo;re being fair. The Cubs have been
as careful as they know how to be in using this property.
We cleaned up the brush and kept all of our
promises.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not blaming anyone,&rdquo; Mr. Kain replied, ill at
ease. &ldquo;Boys will be boys. I&rsquo;m not saying the fire was
started on purpose. But you see my position. I&rsquo;m responsible
to the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you feel we caused the damage, let us pay for
it,&rdquo; Dan spoke up suddenly. &ldquo;Just give us a chance
to finish our play here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The offer seemed to strike a responsive chord with
the bank employee. He paused a moment to consider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; urged Chips, &ldquo;the Cubs have money we
were saving for costumes and scenery. We could
use some of that to pay for the damage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hardly know what to say&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Kain
hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No buildings were destroyed,&rdquo; Brad said quickly.
&ldquo;Only a few shrubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys did work hard to put out the fire once
it started,&rdquo; the bank man admitted. &ldquo;I suppose an
arrangement could be made for you to pay for the
damage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll allow us to finish our play here?&rdquo;
Red demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you agree to pay, I suppose I might let
you stay on for a week or two. But no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much will we owe?&rdquo; Brad asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>He knew that the shrubs which had burned were
not rare or valuable ones. Actually, he thought that
the fire had done very little damage. Although the
blackened area was ugly and disfiguring, new growth
quickly would cover it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five dollars should cover it,&rdquo; Mr. Kain
said, after a little thought.</p>
<p>Now to him the amount seemed comparatively
small. To the Cubs it represented a huge sum. To
meet the debt they would be required to pool every
cent they had earned for costumes and perhaps dip
into the organization treasury as well.</p>
<p>Seeing the look of consternation upon the faces
of the boys, Mr. Kain amended his calculation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be easy on you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Make it
twenty dollars. However, the sum must be paid to
the bank no later than tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad turned to the Cubs of Den 2. &ldquo;How about it
fellows?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Can we do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to,&rdquo; decided Dan grimly. &ldquo;I have three
dollars and a half saved for my costume. I&rsquo;ll toss that
into the kitty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the Cubs of Den 1?&rdquo; Brad asked Ross.
&ldquo;Will they help too?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to ask them,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I know I
can&rsquo;t kick in. I&rsquo;ve already used all my paper route
money to buy a costume.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought Mrs. Holloway was making it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I decided to buy it instead,&rdquo; Ross answered. &ldquo;No
home-made job for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the exception of Ross, all of the Cubs who
were present agreed to the plan. Having pledged
themselves, they then sought Mr. Hatfield to tell
him of their decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what you want to do, it&rsquo;s all right with
me,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;The Cubs always pay their debts.
If the bank feels we&rsquo;re responsible for the damage,
then we&rsquo;ll pay whatever they ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have someone bring the money to the bank tomorrow,&rdquo;
Mr. Kain said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be hard on
the boys, but maybe having to spend their own cash
will teach them to be more careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one replied. Decidedly uncomfortable, the
bank man said good-bye and drove away.</p>
<p>After he had gone, however, the Cubs had a great
deal to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want to be too hard! Oh, no!&rdquo; Midge
mimicked. &ldquo;We worked mighty hard for that
money.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now it all goes to the bank when we didn&rsquo;t
do a thing except cut their old brush!&rdquo; Red stormed.
&ldquo;It makes me sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to do it,&rdquo; Brad reminded the
Cubs. &ldquo;For that matter, we can give up the play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This the Cubs were unwilling to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Old Kill-Joy Kain says we owe twenty dollars
let&rsquo;s pay it,&rdquo; Dan proposed grimly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to dig
up every penny we saved for our costumes. That
means making out with any old materials we can
lay our hands on. Time&rsquo;s too short to earn any more
money now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fat chance we&rsquo;ll have of winning the grand prize
without decent costumes or scenery,&rdquo; Chips said
gloomily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look like a band of tattered beggars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All except Ross,&rdquo; said Red, fastening his gaze
upon the Den 1 boy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have a perfectly super
costume. Maybe, after all, we should award him the
star part!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER 13</span>
<br />Kill-Joy Kain</h2>
<p>Well aware that the other Cubs were out of sorts
and annoyed at him, Ross immediately took issue
with Red&rsquo;s pointed remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it my fault I happened to buy my costume
before this place went up in smoke?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be entitled to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ross is right,&rdquo; Brad spoke up quickly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just
luckier than the rest of us. At least we&rsquo;ll have one
good costume for the play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, but Ross should pay his share of the damage,&rdquo;
Red protested hotly. &ldquo;After all, he&rsquo;s as much
to blame for the fire as we are&mdash;maybe more so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that crack?&rdquo; Ross demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were assigned to clean up the brush in your
section. Well, that was where the fire started!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it! Furthermore, I came out here last
night and raked brush until I was blue in the
face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You probably started a little fire and thought
you had put it out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not so,&rdquo; Ross flung at his accuser. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t prove it. I never touched a match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it out, Red,&rdquo; Brad quietly advised the other
Cub. &ldquo;Ross&rsquo; word is good with me. You have no right
to accuse him when you haven&rsquo;t any evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Red muttered, rather ashamed of himself,
&ldquo;I guess I did speak out of turn. Sorry, Ross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Den 1 boy made no reply. Turning quickly,
he walked to one of the cars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all out of sorts and dead tired,&rdquo; Dan said.
&ldquo;It makes us all jumpy, especially after Mr. Kain
came out here and delivered such a sock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I accused Ross,&rdquo; Red said again. &ldquo;All
the same, we know how he acts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; broke in Brad severely. &ldquo;Mr. Hatfield
is signaling us from the car. He&rsquo;s ready to leave.
I for one will be glad to get home and clean up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, we have to deliver our money to
Mr. Kain tomorrow morning,&rdquo; Dan warned the Cubs
as they started off to the waiting cars. &ldquo;I suppose we
ought to meet at Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s house and all go to
the bank together.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>After the other boys had scattered, he and Brad
gathered up the empty buckets. Several men who
lived not far away had offered to keep watch of the
smoldering woods area, so the Cubs no longer would
be needed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know how that fire actually did start,&rdquo;
Brad remarked. &ldquo;Dan, do you think Ross had anything
to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not intentionally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. I mean, do you think he came
out here last night as he said to clear up the brush?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather think he did, Brad. Maybe that&rsquo;s one reason
the fire didn&rsquo;t spread terribly fast despite the
dryness of the season. He could have dropped
matches or something, but you were right in saying
we shouldn&rsquo;t blame him. We&rsquo;ll probably never know
how the fire started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless we dig up a clue later on when we
can search the area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is burned over. Not much chance of
that, Brad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>The Den Chief stooped to pick up the charred
arrow which Mr. Kain had dropped on the grass.
Carefully he studied it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think that may have significance?&rdquo; Dan
asked after a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so. Maybe not. The arrow could have
been lying out in the woods a long while. We know
our mysterious Robin Hood has shot plenty of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say! That&rsquo;s an idea, Brad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the fire was started by the fellow who has
been roving around here&mdash;the Ghost of the Castle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad smiled, for the thought had occurred to him
when first he saw the charred shaft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know the Ghost is a very real person,&rdquo; he
commented. &ldquo;We also know he roams over this property
and the Castle at will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could be a tramp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought the same thing, Dan. We certainly
shouldn&rsquo;t blame Ross for that fire, until we&rsquo;ve made
as complete an investigation as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what we can discover right now,&rdquo; the
younger boy proposed.</p>
<p>Brad however, vetoed the proposal. He pointed
out that Mr. Holloway and Mr. Hatfield both were
ready to leave for town.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all tuckered out now,&rdquo; he said wearily.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s come back tomorrow. Then we&rsquo;ll have plenty
of time to comb the burned area for clues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Providing the bank sticks by its agreement,&rdquo; Dan
added, sunk in gloom. &ldquo;Even if we do dig up our
money, the officials may change their minds about
allowing us to use this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The destructive fire was disheartening not only
to Dan and Brad, but to all of the Cubs. Even if satisfactory
arrangements were made for their continued
use of the premises, they felt that they would
remain under a cloud of suspicion.</p>
<p>Also, try as they would, they could not muster
their former enthusiasm for presenting and filming
the Robin Hood play. Without elaborate costumes
and scenery they felt they would not have a very
good chance to win first prize.</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway and Sam Hatfield also were troubled.
It seemed rather unjust to them that the bank
should hold the Cub organization responsible for the
fire. Both offered to make good the loss themselves.</p>
<p>The Cubs however, were of one mind on this
matter. They would not hear of the organization
leaders assuming the bill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Mr. Kain will soften up when we take
the money to him,&rdquo; Dan said hopefully.</p>
<p>By pooling their earnings, the boys of the two
Dens were able to accumulate twenty-one dollars
and seventy-five cents. Ross was the only Cub to
make no contribution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My paper route isn&rsquo;t doing well any more,&rdquo; he
complained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided to give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you&rsquo;re giving things up, you might cut out
candy,&rdquo; Chips reminded him, noticing that even as
he talked Ross was nibbling at a chocolate bar. &ldquo;I
guess you have enough spending money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad gave Chips a warning glance and he subsided
into silence. Nevertheless, the seeds of resentment
were deeply planted among the other Cubs.
Nearly all of the boys felt that Ross was taking
a most selfish attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All set to go to the bank?&rdquo; Brad asked the group.</p>
<p>The boys had gathered at Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s house to
pool their money. Now, accompanied by the Cub
leader, they walked three short blocks to the bank.</p>
<p>At such an early morning hour, few customers
were in the institution. Mr. Hatfield inquired for
Mr. Kain and was told he would be found upstairs
in a balcony office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>The Cubs trooped up the stairs, presenting themselves
at the official&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, boys,&rdquo; Mr. Kain said, but his
voice, they noted, was not very friendly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve brought the money,&rdquo; Brad said, taking
out his wallet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the money,&rdquo; Mr. Kain repeated vaguely. He
frowned. Then he said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking the matter
over since I talked with you. The bank feels that
it would be better not to allow the Cubs to use the
property again. We&rsquo;ll forget the amount you owe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said if we paid the twenty dollars we
might finish the filming of our picture!&rdquo; Dan burst
out. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve raised the money. We&rsquo;re keeping our
part of the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Kain stirred uneasily in his swivel chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made further investigation since I talked
with you boys yesterday afternoon. A farmer who
lives not far from the castle grounds, reported to
me that he saw a boy in the woods shortly before
the fire started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Cub?&rdquo; Brad demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;None of the Cubs were there!&rdquo; Dan said indignantly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all given our word on that. Brad
and I were the first to arrive on the scene. The fire
had a good start then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for Brad and Dan, I think the
bank would have lost their building,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
interposed quietly. &ldquo;To replace it at present costs
would require in the neighborhood of a hundred
thousand dollars, I should judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house has no such value as it stands,&rdquo; Mr.
Kain said. &ldquo;However, the bank is grateful to the
Cubs. It&rsquo;s not that. But you see our position. With
so much at stake, we can&rsquo;t risk having irresponsible&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs are not irresponsible,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Mr. Kain spoke with finality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t let us finish our film at the
Castle?&rdquo; Brad demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t allow you to go there. As I say, I&rsquo;m
sorry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs waited to hear no more of his apology.
Completely discouraged, they started down the balcony
steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfair!&rdquo; Red stormed. &ldquo;This bank gives me a
pain!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>Unnoticed by the Cubs, a heavily set man in gray,
which matched the color of his hair, had met them
squarely on the stairway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this about not liking the bank?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>Embarrassed, Red stammered out that Mr. Kain
wasn&rsquo;t being fair to the Cubs. And he added bitterly:
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all the thanks we get for saving their
old house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remark troubled the man, for he said: &ldquo;We
must look into this. Come with me, and we&rsquo;ll talk
to Mr. Kain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the Cubs began to suspect that they
had encountered another official of the bank. They
were sure of it, when as they approached Mr. Kain&rsquo;s
desk again, the man quickly got to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Hammond,&rdquo; he said respectfully.</p>
<p>Mr. Hammond, the boys learned a moment later,
was vice president of the bank. A man of precise
mind, he first asked Mr. Kain for his version of the
disagreement. Then he listened to what Red and
the other Cubs had to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t annoy you about this matter, Mr. Hammond,
because you were busy,&rdquo; Mr. Kain said uneasily.
&ldquo;I thought for the protection of the bank&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Kain, you lose sight of several facts,&rdquo; replied
the bank official. &ldquo;First, the Cubs give their
word they had nothing to do with the fire. Second,
had it not been for them, the Castle undoubtedly
would have been destroyed. And third, it&rsquo;s important
that they finish the movie they&rsquo;re making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only did what I thought was best for the interests
of the bank,&rdquo; Mr. Kain said, his eyes smoldering
with resentment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a nephew who is a Cub Scout in another
city,&rdquo; Mr. Hammond continued. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a dependable
youngster and so are the other Cubs in his outfit.
I&rsquo;ll take a chance on such lads any day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Mr. Kain stiffly. &ldquo;The decision
is yours to make&mdash;not mine. However, I must say
that it&rsquo;s tempting fate to turn loose a pack of boys
on the premises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not turn them loose exactly,&rdquo; smiled the
bank official. &ldquo;I assume they will be under the direction
of their leaders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, sir,&rdquo; Brad assured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also, I&rsquo;ll assign you, Mr. Kain, to accompany the
boys and watch over the property during the filming
of the various scenes,&rdquo; Mr. Hammond added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure you&rsquo;ll guard the bank interests most diligently.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>With that, he nodded to Mr. Hatfield, and moved
on to his own private office.</p>
<p>It was plain to the Cubs that Mr. Kain resented
their interference. This, he indicated, by the cold
formal manner in which he addressed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard what Mr. Hammond said?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;He very generously has allowed you the
use of the premises under my supervision. May I
ask when you will film the next scenes of your play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably Saturday if the weather is pleasant,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield informed him. &ldquo;By that time we should
have costumes and scenery ready. I assure you we&rsquo;ll
wind up the filming as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. Saturday then, I&rsquo;ll be on hand to see
that everything is kept in order. Oh, yes, there&rsquo;s one
more matter&mdash;the twenty dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for crying out loud!&rdquo; Red muttered, but
at a stern look from Mr. Hatfield, he subsided.</p>
<p>Now all the Cubs were certain that Mr. Hammond
had not intended them to pay the sum. However,
they were too proud to argue.</p>
<p>Without saying a word, Brad opened his wallet
and gave the money to Mr. Kain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There go our costumes,&rdquo; remarked Red pointedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Kain, busily writing out a
receipt.</p>
<p>No one repeated the remark.</p>
<p>Brad accepted the receipt, and the Cubs left the
bank.</p>
<p>Red and Midge were in favor of protesting to
Mr. Hammond. However, the Cub leader would
not allow them to do that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, Old Kill-Joy-Kain is taking advantage
of us,&rdquo; Red opined as the boys disconsolately
walked down the street. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sore now, and he&rsquo;ll
see to it that we have no privileges at the Castle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER 14</span>
<br />Clues</h2>
<p>Dan and Brad shared the opinion of the other Cubs
that their &ldquo;fun&rdquo; times were nearly at an end at the
Castle.</p>
<p>Parting company with the other boys, they discussed
the matter as they walked toward their
homes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a cent Mr. Kain won&rsquo;t allow us to go
poking around in the woods,&rdquo; Brad remarked. &ldquo;I
especially wanted to see if we could find any clues
as to how the fire started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we go out there now by ourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to,&rdquo; Brad replied. &ldquo;I sure would. But it
wouldn&rsquo;t be cricket. Mr. Kain takes it for granted
we&rsquo;ll only go there when he&rsquo;s around to watch-dog
us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Dan admitted ruefully.
&ldquo;What we could do though, is to get there early on
Saturday. If we&rsquo;re lucky, we might get an hour&rsquo;s
jump on Mr. Kain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the next few days, the Cubs made what
arrangements they could for costumes. The mothers
of the two Dens came through splendidly, fashioning
garments of whatever materials they had on
hand.</p>
<p>On the whole, the Cubs felt that the play would
not be quite the flop they had feared. Nevertheless,
resentment flared again when Ross displayed the
elegant costume he had purchased at a theatrical
supply store.</p>
<p>Among some of the boys it was whispered that
Ross still expected to be awarded the star role in
the play.</p>
<p>And though Dan and Brad tried to quiet such
rumblings, the Cubs continued to hint that he might
have had something to do with starting the disastrous
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Ross is innocent, the Cubs are doing him a
terrible injustice,&rdquo; Brad said to his friend early Saturday.
The two boys had walked to the Castle
grounds, and by intention were there ahead of the
Pack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could find how the fire really started,&rdquo;
Dan replied soberly. &ldquo;So much time has elapsed
now, all clues probably have been destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may find some more of those arrows, Dan.
They may or may not have significance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys were hopeful of coming upon evidence
to indicate that the fire had been of accidental
nature or had been started by the mysterious
&ldquo;ghost&rdquo; of the Castle.</p>
<p>Their task proved most discouraging. As they
wandered through the blackened, charred area,
they found not a single clue. They did observe that
the damage to shrubs and trees had been relatively
slight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me as if Ross told the truth about
cleaning up the brush,&rdquo; Brad declared, pausing beside
a large pile of charred sticks and debris. &ldquo;See!
He must have gathered it all here in this one place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe touched a match to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ross wouldn&rsquo;t be that stupid. He knows better
than to start a fire in a wooded area. Anyway, you
can see the fire didn&rsquo;t start in this pile of brush. It
spread from some distance back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan agreed with his friend&rsquo;s observation. Both
could see where the fire had followed a line of least
resistance along a winding road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I wonder where that road leads?&rdquo; Dan speculated.
&ldquo;I never noticed it here before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curious to learn whether or not it joined the main
road, they followed it for a short distance.</p>
<p>Before the boys had gone far, they discovered
that it twisted in among the trees, leading behind
the Castle. From there it swung to the right, presently
coming out within view of the adjoining estate.
By this time the Cubs had learned that the property
was owned by a Colonel Brekenridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sense going any farther,&rdquo; Brad said, halting.
&ldquo;For all we know, we may be trespassing on Brekenridge
land. If the Colonel&rsquo;s gardener should spot us,
he&rsquo;d make trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The road hasn&rsquo;t been used much of late,&rdquo; Dan
said, noting that it was clogged with grass.</p>
<p>Pausing in the clearing, the boys gazed toward
the pillared Brekenridge home. No one was to be
seen either in the yard or on the veranda.</p>
<p>After a casual inspection, the pair started back
the way they had come.</p>
<p>They had covered about two-thirds of the distance
to the Castle, when Dan abruptly halted to
study a charred irregular area at the side of the
road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, it looks as if someone had a camp fire here!&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;Recently too, because rains haven&rsquo;t
disturbed any of the ashes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad turned to gaze at the area his companion
indicated.</p>
<p>Immediately he noticed a snake-like black tail of
burned ground leading toward another charred area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, this must be where the fire started!&rdquo; he
cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wind was blowing toward the Castle all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear as day,&rdquo; Brad declared, walking over
to the dead ashes of the bonfire. &ldquo;Someone built this,
and didn&rsquo;t put it out entirely. Then the person went
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it slowly spread,&rdquo; Dan agreed. &ldquo;First in this
narrow tail, and then after it struck that section of
dry leaves and grass it spread out rapidly through
the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys carefully examined the dead embers. Beside
them was a blackened tin can which had been
used for cooking purposes. Dan also picked up a
half-burned stick with the remains of a roasted
weiner still attached.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This fire must have been started by a boy,&rdquo; he
said slowly. &ldquo;Or possibly by a tramp. Brad, do you
suppose it could have been Ross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t build a fire as carelessly as this,&rdquo;
the Den Chief pointed out. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s had Cub training
in how to lay his sticks. No, I&rsquo;m more than ever
convinced, Dan, that the fire wasn&rsquo;t his fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Decidedly relieved to think that they had found
evidence which tended to exonerate Ross, the two
Cubs traced the start of the fire. Plainly they could
see where it had leaped over a narrow ditch and
then moved in several directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Ross didn&rsquo;t start the fire, who did?&rdquo; Dan speculated
as the boys started down the road again.
&ldquo;Our mysterious Ghost of the Castle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could be. I&rsquo;d like to catch that guy who keeps
horning into our pictures. Maybe we will too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any ideas?&rdquo; Dan asked.</p>
<p>Before Brad could reply, both boys were startled
to hear a babble of voices ahead on the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a delegation,&rdquo; Brad murmured. &ldquo;I
wonder if the Cubs have arrived for rehearsals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rounding a bend of the road, the two boys
caught a glimpse of four Den 2 boys who had gathered
in a huddle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>Their backs were to Dan and Brad. So earnestly
were they talking, that they failed to observe the
approach of the two Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; Dan
and Brad heard Red say distinctly. &ldquo;We all know
Ross is guilty. So it&rsquo;s up to us to see that he&rsquo;s punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, and let&rsquo;s think up a good one,&rdquo; proposed
Chips. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to teach that little guy a lesson
he won&rsquo;t forget!&rdquo;</p>

<br />A Message</h2>
<p>As Dan and Brad walked up, the Cubs broke up
their circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having a little conference?&rdquo; the Den Chief inquired
pointedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just talking,&rdquo; Midge Holloway replied uneasily.</p>
<p>The group was comprised of Red, Chips, Midge
and Fred.</p>
<p>Brad fixed his gaze disapprovingly upon the four
conspirators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed of you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Plotting behind
Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s back. You didn&rsquo;t figure on letting Dan
or me know what you were doing either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t done anything yet,&rdquo; Midge defended
the group. &ldquo;Furthermore, we haven&rsquo;t had a
chance to talk over this matter with anyone. My
Dad brought us out here only ten minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It seems you had to come back into the woods
for your high-powered conference,&rdquo; Brad said
sternly. &ldquo;I guess you didn&rsquo;t want Mr. Holloway to
hear you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if we didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Red demanded, glaring at
the Den Chief. &ldquo;You had your chance to do something
about Ross and you let it slide. Now it&rsquo;s our
turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just what do you have against him? Let&rsquo;s
hear your evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got plenty,&rdquo; Red announced grimly.
&ldquo;The lug bought himself a fancy costume and didn&rsquo;t
kick in a dime to pay for the fire damage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was lucky enough to have bought his costume
before the trouble developed. Why be jealous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not jealous,&rdquo; Chips broke in. &ldquo;We believe
in justice, that&rsquo;s all. From the way Ross acted, we&rsquo;re
sure he never did his work here as he was supposed
to. Either that, or he came out and started the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem a bit hazy as to what you think he
did do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One way or the other, he was responsible for
the fire,&rdquo; Chips insisted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wild talk, and Dan and I can prove it!&rdquo;
Brad replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve learned how the fire did
start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys showed the other Cubs the dead
bonfire ashes, the tin can and the charred weiner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ross wouldn&rsquo;t have built a fire this way,&rdquo; Midge
conceded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Brad. We&rsquo;ve misjudged
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Ross didn&rsquo;t start the fire, then who did?&rdquo; demanded
Red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the question we&rsquo;d all like to have answered,&rdquo;
Dan told him. &ldquo;If we could find the answer,
it might clear us at the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might try to keep watch of this road,&rdquo; Brad
suggested. &ldquo;I have a hunch whoever started that
fire will be using it again. By watching we might
learn something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other Cubs agreed that the proposal was a
good one. They pointed out, however, that with
Mr. Kain on hand to see that no one roved too far
afield, any sleuthing must be carried on under difficulties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admit we&rsquo;re handicapped,&rdquo; Brad acknowledged.
&ldquo;At any rate we know this road is the place
to watch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>The Cubs emerged from the woods just as Mr.
Hatfield drove up with another car loaded with
boys from Den 1. Ross was among them.</p>
<p>Seeing the group of Den 2 boys, he turned as if
to walk in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ross!&rdquo; called Brad.</p>
<p>The boy turned reluctantly and waited for the
Den Chief. Then before Brad could tell him about
the discovery, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the fellows are sore at me, thinking I
caused all the trouble with the bank. I&rsquo;m quitting
the Pack. You can have my costume if you want it.
Or give it to Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ross, you can&rsquo;t leave the outfit,&rdquo; Brad protested.
&ldquo;We need you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs will be glad to see me go. I&rsquo;ve annoyed
them from the start, and now they think I caused
the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may have thought that at first, but they
have the right slant now. Listen, Ross, you can be a
big help in straightening this mess out if you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Den Chief then told him of the discovery
made near the old road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can help us try to learn the identity of the
Castle ghost,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;If we find him, we may
learn who caused the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>Brad&rsquo;s words encouraged Ross. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep watch,&rdquo;
he promised. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to drop out of the Pack&mdash;but
the fellows have made it plenty tough for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Brad admitted. &ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t act so know-it-all
and their attitude will change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rehearsals began presently. As yet Mr. Kain had
not appeared on the scene, and the boys were hopeful
that he would fail to come.</p>
<p>However, shortly after the actual filming began,
his car drove up.</p>
<p>Obviously displeased, Mr. Kain watched the boys
for a few minutes. Then he began a minute inspection
of the Castle itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s looking around to see if he can&rsquo;t find where
we&rsquo;ve damaged something,&rdquo; Chips muttered. &ldquo;If he
discovers a single thing he&rsquo;ll use it as an excuse to
bounce us for good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Made uncomfortable by Mr. Kain&rsquo;s presence, the
boys did not act their parts well. Repeatedly, Mr.
Holloway had to take scenes over.</p>
<p>Mr. Kain completed his inspection of the inside
of the Castle and returned to watch rehearsals.</p>
<p>As the sun rose higher, he became more and more
impatient. He would wander to his car, sit there
awhile, and then return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>From his scowl, no one questioned that he felt
the Cubs were taking entirely too much time on the
grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon do you expect to wind this up?&rdquo; he
finally asked Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>The Cub leader told him that the boys probably
would not be ready to leave for another hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait that long,&rdquo; the bank official protested.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wasted two hours here now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t necessary for you to remain unless you
feel you must, Mr. Kain. I can promise that the Cubs
will do no damage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have another errand,&rdquo; the bank employee
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll attend to it and then drop back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked to his car. But as he started to open
the door, his attention fastened upon an object lying
in the dust.</p>
<p>The Cubs saw him pick it up and examine it
carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s he found?&rdquo; Dan muttered. &ldquo;It must
be something he&rsquo;s going to hook onto us. Here he
comes back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carrying the object, Mr. Kain returned to the
group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I found this lying on the grass beside my car,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Maybe one of you youngsters can explain
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Kain held up the shaft of an arrow. Attached
to it was a scroll of paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mysterious archer again!&rdquo; exclaimed Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does the message say?&rdquo; demanded Red
impatiently.</p>
<p>Mr. Kain already had read it. He handed the
paper to Brad. The words were written in a childish,
nearly illegible scrawl. Brad read them aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look in Robin Hood&rsquo;s Strong Box. You will find
something of interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robin Hood&rsquo;s strong box,&rdquo; Dan repeated, recalling
the Castle chimney niche which had been given
that name. &ldquo;Well, what do you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This message seems to make sense to you, if not
to me,&rdquo; Mr. Kain said testily. &ldquo;Will someone kindly
explain what is meant by Robin Hood&rsquo;s strong box?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER 16</span>
<br />Treasure</h2>
<p>The Cubs were reluctant to tell Mr. Kain their
secret, lest he feel that they had overstepped themselves
in investigating the Castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robin Hood&rsquo;s Strong Box is just a name for a
hiding place,&rdquo; Dan explained vaguely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then one of you boys shot this arrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs looked from one to another. Each boy
shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mysterious archer has been annoying us a bit
by shooting arrows during our rehearsals,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
explained. &ldquo;This shaft looks as if it may have
come from his bow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did he know about Robin Hood&rsquo;s Strong
Box?&rdquo; Midge muttered. &ldquo;The guy must be psychic.
Either that, or he sneaks around listening to our
conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite certain this arrow was not lying near
my car when I drove into the grounds today,&rdquo; Mr.
Kain said. &ldquo;It has been shot in the last hour or
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably a joke,&rdquo; Chips commented. He
wished fervently that the bank employee would
leave and be done with his prying questions. Once
he was out of the way, the Cubs could organize an
intensive search!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys seem to know what is meant by Robin
Hood&rsquo;s Strong Box. I rather think you&rsquo;re trying to
keep something from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing mysterious about it,&rdquo; Brad said,
reluctantly deciding to reveal the hiding place.
&ldquo;Robin Hood&rsquo;s Strong Box is merely a name we gave
to a niche in the fireplace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inside the Castle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have been roving around inside
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Brad replied indignantly. &ldquo;We
found the hiding place long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show it to me,&rdquo; the bank employee requested.</p>
<p>The Cubs would have preferred to do their investigating
in his absence. But there was no escape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>Unwillingly, they walked with him back to the
Castle. Dan noticed that the broken window had
not yet been repaired and remarked about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve ordered new panes put in,&rdquo; Mr. Kain said.
&ldquo;Workmen have been very slow. Rest assured
though, the work will be done no later than tomorrow.
I am quite annoyed to find so much activity
hereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs would have entered through the window,
but the bank official would not permit it.</p>
<p>Instead, he unlocked the front door. A faint odor
of smoke still lingered in the cool empty rooms, but
this Mr. Kain did not notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now show me Robin Hood&rsquo;s Strong Box,&rdquo; he
directed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe this message is anything
but a joke. Nevertheless, I want to see the hiding
place that is meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Cubs led him toward the massive fireplace,
Dan brought up the rear. Glancing from one Cub
to another, he noticed that Ross was missing from
the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of Ross?&rdquo; the boy whispered to
Midge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he was with us when we started for the
Castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so. He&rsquo;s wandered off somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>Curious to learn what had become of the boy,
Dan went to one of the grimy windows and looked
out.</p>
<p>Ross was not to be seen anywhere on the grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have thought ordinary
curiosity would have made him come with the other
Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one can tell what Ross will do, or where he&rsquo;ll
go,&rdquo; Midge said with a shrug. &ldquo;That lad is unpredictable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs gathered in a half circle about the fireplace.
Brad explained to Mr. Kain how the chimney
hiding place had been found.</p>
<p>Before he could search the niche, the bank employee
crouched down and squinted up the dark
hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing here,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see the niche,&rdquo; Brad told him. &ldquo;But
if you run your hand up against the wall, you can
feel it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Kain obeyed instructions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still nothing here,&rdquo; he declared. He withdrew
his arm and brushed cobwebs from his coat sleeve.
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s no more than I expected.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>One and all, the Cubs were disappointed. They
had hoped&mdash;indeed, had been confident that a surprise
awaited them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Castle ghost has an unpleasant sense of
humor,&rdquo; Midge complained. &ldquo;First he shoots arrows
into the target just to show us how much better he
is at archery than we are. And now this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Kain asked the boys several questions concerning
the strange person who had appeared from
time to time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think he may have been the one who started
the fire,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;So far, we have no proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might be somewhat difficult to obtain at
this late date,&rdquo; the bank employee replied.</p>
<p>Smiling in a more friendly way, he turned to
leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, boys,&rdquo; he said as they would have
loitered. &ldquo;I want to lock up the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway, Mr. Hatfield and the Cubs followed
the bank man to the door.</p>
<p>Without being noticed, Dan and Brad held back.
Both were unwilling to leave the Castle without
investigating the chimney niche themselves.</p>
<p>Dan ran his hand up the wall, groping carefully
about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing there?&rdquo; Brad demanded impatiently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; the younger boy replied in disgust.
&ldquo;Mr. Kain was right. Say&mdash;wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Dan spoke, his hand brushed against a tiny
object far back in the niche.</p>
<p>In an attempt to grasp it, he succeeded in pushing
it farther back, almost beyond reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you found?&rdquo; Brad asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know yet,&rdquo; Dan grunted. &ldquo;My fingers
touched something. Then whatever it was slipped
away from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the outside door, Mr. Kain and the Cubs were
waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Dan!&rdquo; Midge called.</p>
<p>Paying no heed, the boy groped again in the
chimney niche.</p>
<p>This time he was able to fasten his fingers about
the object.</p>
<p>He could feel its soft covering, and something
hard inside.</p>
<p>Aware that Dan had made a discovery, the other
Cubs quickly returned to the living room.</p>
<p>As they gathered about the hearth, the boy
brought the object to light.</p>
<p>Held tightly in his hand was a small leather
pouch with a drawstring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It seems Robin Hood&rsquo;s Strong Box does have
something for us after all!&rdquo; he declared triumphantly.</p>
<p>The leather bag evidently had not been long in
the niche for it was only slightly soiled.</p>
<p>On either side were stamped strange red and
black symbols.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! What do you suppose it contains?&rdquo; Fred
demanded. &ldquo;Treasure, I bet! Open it quick, Dan,
and pour out the gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER 17</span>
<br />A Valuable Collection</h2>
<p>Dan loosened the draw string of the leather bag.</p>
<p>As Mr. Kain, the Cubs and their leaders gathered
close about, he spilled the contents out into his
outstretched hand.</p>
<p>For a moment no one spoke.</p>
<p>The bag contained perhaps fifteen coins of foreign
make. Nearly all were of silver and apparently
quite old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shoot!&rdquo; exclaimed Midge in disappointment.
&ldquo;I thought we might find a real treasure. Just a few
old coins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least it&rsquo;s better than nothing,&rdquo; Dan said, fingering
one of the coins. &ldquo;Even if we can&rsquo;t spend
them, they&rsquo;re worth saving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see that coin,&rdquo; Mr. Kain requested suddenly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>Surprised by the bank employee&rsquo;s tone, Dan
handed it over.</p>
<p>Immediately the man became very excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say these are worth saving!&rdquo; he said
emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re valuable old coins?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be my opinion. This one, I&rsquo;m sure,
is a very old carlino.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Red blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t carlinos minted in Italy?&rdquo; Mr. Holloway
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Formerly they were used in Naples, Sicily and
Rome,&rdquo; Mr. Kain said. &ldquo;The coin obtained its name
from the emperor Charles VI in whose time the coin
first was issued.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is this coin a real old one?&rdquo; Fred asked in
awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an expert on such matters,&rdquo; Mr. Kain
admitted. &ldquo;This silver piece though, very much resembles
a similar coin in the British Museum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it should be worth a lot!&rdquo; exclaimed Midge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off hand, I should be inclined to agree. I can&rsquo;t
make out the date,&rdquo; the bank employee said, studying
the reverse side of the coin. &ldquo;It looks as if it
might be 1740 or 1730. I know the coins were made
as early as 1730.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, we have found ourselves something!&rdquo; Fred
murmured in awe. &ldquo;Pass those other coins around,
Dan. Let&rsquo;s see what they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Dan could do so, Mr. Kain seized upon
another battered coin in the collection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very old gold coin!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;If
I&rsquo;m not mistaken it&rsquo;s one they call an &lsquo;angel.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is an angel?&rdquo; questioned Fred, who never
had heard of a coin by such a name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an English gold coin, originally of the
value of 6s. 8d. sterling. Such coins first were struck
off by Edward IV in 1465 and I believe were made
until 1634.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ve come upon a museum piece,&rdquo; remarked
Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These coins are priceless,&rdquo; the bank man declared.
&ldquo;That is, if they are genuine. As I say, I am
not an expert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greatly impressed, the Cubs passed the coin
around. Though it was badly worn they could
faintly distinguish the figure of the archangel
Michael defeating a dragon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A museum would pay a large sum to add such
a coin to its collection. If my memory serves me,
I&rsquo;ve seen pictures of one of these angels on display
at the British Museum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you suppose the coins came from?&rdquo;
Brad speculated. &ldquo;We know they couldn&rsquo;t have been
in the chimney niche very long. The hiding place
was empty when we looked there a few days
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bag of coins must be a contribution from
the Ghost of the Castle,&rdquo; Dan said half in jest. &ldquo;Say,
you know he isn&rsquo;t such a bad fellow after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to the two very old coins, the collection
contained several half dollars of U. S. mintage.
These, Mr. Kain said also were valuable to collectors,
though far less in demand than the rare angel
and carlino.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of the coins I am unable to identify,&rdquo; the
bank employee admitted. &ldquo;I do know enough about
money though, to be certain you have a valuable
collection here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say! Maybe we&rsquo;ll be able to buy costumes for
the play after all!&rdquo; Midge declared jubilantly. &ldquo;How
much do you think these coins will bring, Mr.
Kain?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is impossible to say.&rdquo; The bank man returned
all of the coins to the leather bag. &ldquo;We must
have them appraised. And then, the question of
ownership arises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the Cubs the word had an ominous sound.
They were certain the treasure had been intended
for them.</p>
<p>Belatedly, they remembered that the Castle belonged
to the bank. If he chose to do so, Mr. Kain
could claim the property. From his expression, they
were positive he meant to keep the collection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ownership should be determined,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
agreed quietly. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem reasonable to me
that anyone in his right mind would give away such
highly valuable coins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever we find that mysterious archer, we&rsquo;ll have
the answer,&rdquo; Dan declared.</p>
<p>Mr. Kain, in a far better mood now that the coins
had been discovered, urged the Cubs to tell him
what they knew of the trespasser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t see him very often but we know he
watches us when we rehearse for our play,&rdquo; Dan answered.
&ldquo;Several times he&rsquo;s shot arrows and he&rsquo;s
very good with a bow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever had a good look at the man?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re inclined to think he may be a boy,&rdquo; Mr.
Holloway spoke up. &ldquo;At least in one of the movie
scenes, we caught a fleeting glimpse of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A boy, eh?&rdquo; Mr. Kain repeated, fingering the
bag of coins. &ldquo;In that case, he might not have a
right to this collection. It could have been stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, that&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; exclaimed Red, rather
alarmed. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to get mixed up in anything
shady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; Mr. Kain assured the Cubs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
take charge of these coins&mdash;for the bank of course.
I&rsquo;ll make every effort to trace the owner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you fail?&rdquo; asked Brad significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if the owner can&rsquo;t be found after a reasonable
length of time, the coins will become bank
property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even when Dan found &rsquo;em?&rdquo; Chips asked indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear you are unfamiliar with the laws governing
property,&rdquo; Mr. Kain said. &ldquo;Now the statutes of
this state say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs were never to learn what the state laws
set forth, for at that moment there came an interruption.</p>
<p>The Cubs were startled to hear a sharp rattle on
a window pane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Fred demanded.</p>
<p>Everyone turned to look. Someone stood at the
living room, his face pressed against the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ghost!&rdquo; exclaimed Chips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ghost, my Adam&rsquo;s apple!&rdquo; Brad snorted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
Ross Langdon. He only wants to see what we&rsquo;re
doing in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this latter point, however, the Den Chief was
mistaken.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to learn what the Cubs were
doing, the Den 1 boy frantically motioned for the
group to join him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails Ross, anyhow?&rdquo; Midge muttered.</p>
<p>As the boy&rsquo;s strange antics continued, the Cubs
became convinced that something actually was
wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what he wants,&rdquo; Dan said, starting for
the door.</p>
<p>Ross ran around the side of the house to meet
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, come quick!&rdquo; he urged breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Ross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saw whom, Ross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That little guy that shoots arrows!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where, Ross?&rdquo; Dan now became excited, for in
view of the bag of coins that had been found, he
knew it was vitally important to catch the intruder.</p>
<p>Before Ross could answer, the other Cubs, Mr.
Kain, Mr. Holloway and Sam Hatfield gathered
around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you all started here to see what was in
Robin Hood&rsquo;s Strong Box, I hid out,&rdquo; Ross explained,
talking rapidly. &ldquo;I figured whoever shot
that arrow must be hiding close by. I thought he&rsquo;d
probably show himself once everyone was inside
the Castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sound reasoning,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hid in the bushes. Sure enough. I hadn&rsquo;t been
lying low many minutes when out pops a kid no
older than Dan here. He had a bow in his hand
so I know he was the one we&rsquo;re after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he do?&rdquo; Dan demanded impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he sneaked fairly close to the Castle and
raised his bow as if to shoot. I thought he was going
to send an arrow flying through the broken window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you sneak up from behind and nab
him?&rdquo; Brad demanded. &ldquo;That was your chance,
Ross.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I got a little excited. I started after him all right,
but I made too much noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He heard you coming and ran?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, sir. See, he dropped his bow here
by the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ross picked up the bow which was made of
lemonwood and gave it to Mr. Hatfield. The Cub
leader did not take time to examine it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way did the fellow go?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t try to follow him, Ross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I saw him start down that winding road
through the burned area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way he always goes!&rdquo; cried Dan. &ldquo;He
must live somewhere near here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can trail him if we hurry,&rdquo; urged
Brad. He gazed questioningly at the Cub leader,
hopefully awaiting an order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take after him,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield proposed,
hesitating only momentarily. &ldquo;Our mysterious archer
has many questions to answer! If we move fast, we
may catch him this time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER 18</span>
<br />Billy Hides Out</h2>
<p>Led by Ross and Mr. Hatfield, the Cubs rapidly
combed the woods in the immediate vicinity of the
Castle.</p>
<p>The boy had completely vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re wasting time searching for him among the
trees,&rdquo; Dan offered his opinion. &ldquo;I have a hunch he
went straight down the road, maybe to the Brekenridge
estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so too,&rdquo; Ross supported the opinion. &ldquo;I
heard him running as if he expected to be followed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs set off at a fast pace through the
burned area. Mr. Kain, in poor physical trim, found
it difficult to keep pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incidentally, here is where the fire started,&rdquo; Dan
pointed out to the banker as they passed the remains
of the small bonfire where the weiner had
been roasted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, this isn&rsquo;t on bank property,&rdquo; Mr. Kain
noted. &ldquo;Possibly I have been unjust in blaming the
Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys reached the end of the road without
seeing anyone.</p>
<p>Disappointed, they halted at the edge of the
Brekenridge estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy may have taken off in any direction
from here,&rdquo; Mr. Kain said doubtfully. &ldquo;Who lives at
that house with the pillars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the place is rented by a Colonel Brekenridge,&rdquo;
Mr. Holloway supplied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never met
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the trees the Cubs could see someone
seated on the veranda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be Mr. Brekenridge,&rdquo; the bank man
commented. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ask him if he&rsquo;s seen anyone pass
this way in the last ten or fifteen minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may not get a chance to talk to the estate
owner,&rdquo; Dan hinted. &ldquo;The gardener there doesn&rsquo;t
care for visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not to be deterred by this warning, the men
pushed on, followed by the Cubs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>Scarcely had they started up the lane from the
entrance gate than a dog began to bark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be announced all right,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;This
place is well guarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Cubs expected, the barking of the dog
brought the gardener to see what was amiss.</p>
<p>Immediately he recognized Dan and Brad, who
walked somewhat in advance of the others in the
group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I told you to stay away from here,&rdquo;
he said angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important that we see Mr. Brekenridge,&rdquo;
Brad insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t talk to him and that&rsquo;s final,&rdquo; the
man snapped.</p>
<p>By this time the others in the group had come up.
Seeing such a large delegation, the gardener did not
know what to make of it. Nevertheless, he was determined
that his authority should not be questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should like to see the master of this estate,&rdquo;
requested Mr. Hatfield politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Brekenridge&rsquo;s orders are to keep everyone
off the estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because he likes privacy, the colonel does. Now
move along and don&rsquo;t be making me any more
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some distance away an elderly man could be
seen reclining on a porch chair. Mr. Hatfield was
convinced that it must be Mr. Brekenridge himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you please tell the colonel that visitors are
here?&rdquo; the Cub leader requested. &ldquo;After all, we
would not insist upon seeing him but the matter is
important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a business matter, you can tell me. I&rsquo;ll
report to Mr. Brekenridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we have to say is for the colonel&rsquo;s ears
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the colonel&rsquo;s ears ain&rsquo;t going to hear it!&rdquo;
the gardener retorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in charge here and I
say you&rsquo;re not to bother the master. He&rsquo;s not well
enough to talk to anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, we&rsquo;ll not press the matter,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
accepted dismissal. &ldquo;However, since Colonel
Brekenridge is up and about, I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Visitors worry him,&rdquo; the gardener cut in. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t
aiming to be unfriendly, but my orders are to see
he&rsquo;s not disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; the Cub leader said. &ldquo;But first, tell
us if you&rsquo;ve seen a boy pass this way in the last
ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trimming a hedge. I ain&rsquo;t had time to
be looking for anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield, aware that the man
would give no information. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the Cubs started to leave. As they moved
away, they heard a faint call from the veranda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Pete!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gardener became somewhat confused upon
seeing that Colonel Brekenridge was beckoning to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell those folks to come here,&rdquo; the master of the
estate called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard him,&rdquo; the gardener muttered, annoyed
that Colonel Brekenridge had interfered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s willing
to see you. Why, I wouldn&rsquo;t know, after telling
me to keep folks away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs and the three men went on to the pillared
veranda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>Colonel Brekenridge, once a large man now
wasted to a shadow of his former self, lay in a specially
built reclining wheel chair. He wore glasses
and had been reading, for several English magazines
and <i>The Spectator</i> were spread on a table
beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were sending these people away, Pete?&rdquo; the
master of the estate asked the gardener. &ldquo;Did I not
hear them ask to see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know you&rsquo;re not to over-tire yourself, Colonel
Brekenridge,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;I was only
trying to look after your best interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you were,&rdquo; the colonel replied kindly.
&ldquo;Sometimes I fear you are inclined to be over-zealous
in your duty. At any rate, I am feeling much
better these days and welcome interesting visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust we&rsquo;ll prove interesting then,&rdquo; said Mr.
Hatfield with a smile. &ldquo;In any case we will endeavor
to be brief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Brekenridge waved the three men into
porch chairs. The Cubs sat on the steps in front of
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not as much of an invalid as my gardener
would have you believe,&rdquo; the colonel said with a
smile. &ldquo;When I first came here to live, I was seriously
ill and required absolute quiet. Now, I&rsquo;m
happy to say, I appear well on the road to recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>The three men introduced themselves and presented
the Cubs. Mr. Hatfield then explained that
the boys had been using the adjoining property in
rehearsing for a play which they hoped soon to
put on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had a fire over there the other day, didn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; the colonel inquired. &ldquo;I saw smoke and was
a little worried lest this property be in danger. Fortunately
for my interests, the wind carried it in the
other direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still trying to learn how that fire started,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield said. &ldquo;That is not our reason for coming
here today though. We&rsquo;re searching for someone
who hid a small bag inside the Castle, and then
ran off in this direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought you might have seen him come this
way,&rdquo; Mr. Kain added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t say I have. I must admit I dozed off
for fifteen or twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs now felt that they were at a complete
dead-end in their search for the elusive archer. Believing
that Colonel Brekenridge was unable to provide
any useful clues, they arose to leave.</p>
<p>At this point, however, Mr. Kain brought out the
small leather bag.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>Even before the bank employee explained anything
about it, the colonel&rsquo;s eyes fastened attentively
upon the pouch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That little bag has a familiar look,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t yours by chance?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Kain in
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those symbols remind me of a bag I once
owned. May I see it please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; Mr. Kain offered the coin-filled
leather pouch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This certainly looks like a bag I once bought
from an Indian on one of my trips through the
west,&rdquo; Colonel Brekenridge said. &ldquo;Come to think of
it, I don&rsquo;t know what ever became of it either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a coin collector perhaps?&rdquo; interposed
Mr. Holloway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have no hobbies. In my younger days I
enjoyed travel and picked up a few curios. But in
no sense of the word could you call me a collector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curiously, Colonel Brekenridge felt of the coins
inside the bag. Mr. Kain bade him open the pouch.</p>
<p>The colonel poured the coins out onto the robe
which covered his wheel chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;These too have a somewhat
familiar appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the coins are yours?&rdquo; asked Mr. Kain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I think I recognize them. They belonged
to my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the boy here now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Brekenridge smiled as he moved his
wheel chair so that the sun would not shine directly
into his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my son is a grown man,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;At
present he is abroad serving in the army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This puzzle grows more confusing by the minute,&rdquo;
declared Mr. Holloway. &ldquo;Suppose we tell you
exactly how we came into possession of the bag of
coins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Den Dad then related how the arrow with
a message attached had been shot near Mr. Kain&rsquo;s
car.</p>
<p>Colonel Brekenridge&rsquo;s amazement increased as he
learned that the bag had been hidden inside the
chimney of the bank-owned dwelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These coins are very valuable,&rdquo; he assured the
Cubs. &ldquo;I am certain it was never my intention to
give them away. As I said, they belonged to my
son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you explain how the bag came to be in the
hiding place?&rdquo; Dan questioned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When last I saw that bag it was reposing in a
drawer of a desk upstairs,&rdquo; Colonel Brekenridge replied.
&ldquo;But I might have a theory&mdash;yes, it amounts
practically to a conviction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The invalid winked at the gardener. &ldquo;We do have
an archer in our family, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, that we do,&rdquo; the man admitted with a
heavy sigh. &ldquo;Many a time he&rsquo;s nearly winged me
with his arrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Brekenridge requested the gardener to
call his nurse.</p>
<p>A rustle of stiffly starched white uniform heralded
her arrival a moment later. The young woman bore
a glass of milk and two tablets on a tray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have visitors, Colonel,&rdquo; she observed
somewhat disapprovingly. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid of
over-exerting yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; he rumbled. &ldquo;Never felt better.
I suspect I&rsquo;ve been dying of boredom these last few
months. What I need is more visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel, it is time for your medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Medicine, be hanged! I&rsquo;m sick of those ghastly
concoctions the doctor has been forcing down me.
And no more of that wretched milk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are feeling better, Colonel! Such spirit!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m deep in a mystery,&rdquo; the colonel smiled. &ldquo;With
your help though, I think we may be able to solve
it. Miss Aldringham, will you find my grandson,
Billy, and send him here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best, Colonel. That boy has a way of
disappearing for hours at a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the absence of the nurse, Colonel Brekenridge
told the Cubs a little about himself. He said
he had rented the house six months earlier, but had
not been too pleased with the quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For one thing, my grandson has had no playmates,&rdquo;
he explained. &ldquo;The boy came to me three
months ago from England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Dan&rsquo;s look of surprise, the colonel explained
that Billy was an American by birth. He had spent
many years in England and other foreign countries
however, in company with his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy hasn&rsquo;t been very happy here,&rdquo; he remarked
sadly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a live wire and hasn&rsquo;t had enough to
do. Then I must admit I&rsquo;ve been so ill I&rsquo;ve scarcely
concerned myself with his social needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Aldringham returned to the porch to report
that she could not find Billy anywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His room is empty,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t find
him on the grounds either.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Drat that boy!&rdquo; the colonel exclaimed. &ldquo;Sometimes
it seems to me he deliberately hides out! Since
he&rsquo;s been up to mischief, he probably figures he&rsquo;ll
be punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs might not have learned the answer to
their many questions for days to come. At that
moment, however, Dan&rsquo;s alert gaze chanced to rove
toward a clump of bushes behind the veranda.</p>
<p>The Cub was startled to catch a glimpse of a
touseled brown head of hair. A pair of blue eyes
gazed squarely into his own from amid the foliage.</p>
<p>Then the face was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw someone in that rhododendron bush just
then!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nail him!&rdquo; commanded the colonel.</p>
<p>Dan and the gardener both made a dive for the
bush.</p>
<p>They emerged with a small boy in tow. Not more
than eleven years of age, he wore English cut
trousers which he had rolled to the knees. His
freckled, deeply tanned face was smeared with dirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Billy, I guess you knew you were wanted,&rdquo;
the colonel said severely. &ldquo;Hiding out, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>His curious gaze moved from one Cub Scout to
another and finally came to rest on the leather
pouch which his grandfather held.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy, you have a few matters to explain, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy grinned at his grandfather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; he admitted, undisturbed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
you whatever you want to know&mdash;only first you
have to promise not to punish me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll drive no bargain with me, young man. Sit
down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Billy gulped, collapsing on the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we delve into other matters, there is one
question I will ask,&rdquo; said the colonel severely. &ldquo;Did
you or did you not have anything to do with starting
a fire at the Castle?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER 19</span>
<br />A New Cub</h2>
<p>The point-blank question did not disconcert Billy
Brekenridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Grandfather,&rdquo; he replied soberly. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t start the fire. That is, I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to be very certain, Billy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you roast weiners that morning?&rdquo; interposed
Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; the boy replied, thinking hard. &ldquo;Oh, yes,
I did, too. It was only a little fire though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little fires have a way of spreading into large
ones if they are carelessly tended,&rdquo; remarked Mr.
Hatfield. &ldquo;On that particular day a strong wind was
blowing in the direction of the Castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think I started that big fire?&rdquo; Billy
asked, his eyes wide and very blue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re afraid you may have done it unintentionally,&rdquo;
his grandfather replied. &ldquo;Billy, I fear I have
neglected you of late, not paying as much attention
to your comings and goings as I should have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy said nothing, but stirred uncomfortably. He
took it for granted he was to be severely punished
for having caused the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now there are other questions to be asked,&rdquo; his
grandfather resumed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite handy with a
bow and arrow, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be,&rdquo; the boy answered. &ldquo;I learned in
England. My father taught me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ross Langdon produced the bow which had been
picked up by the Castle.</p>
<p>Before he could offer it to Billy, the boy claimed
the property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s mine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I dropped it when I ran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re the ghost of the Castle?&rdquo; Dan asked
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only the name we gave you. But you&rsquo;re
the one who shot arrows into our target during the
tournament?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the one who kept peeking at us as we acted
out our movie scenes?&rdquo; Brad questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Billy admitted with a grin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then it follows that you&rsquo;re the mysterious archer
who shot that arrow near Mr. Kain&rsquo;s automobile,&rdquo;
Dan resumed. &ldquo;You told us to search in Robin
Hood&rsquo;s Strong Box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find the treasure?&rdquo; Billy demanded. &ldquo;I
know you did, because I see Grandfather has the
bag of coins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Brekenridge directed a stern gaze upon
his grandson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you hide the coins in the Castle chimney
niche, Billy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I wanted the Cubs to have &rsquo;em,&rdquo; the
boy answered promptly. &ldquo;They need money to buy
costumes for their play. This was all I had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the Cubs had felt any resentment toward Billy,
it melted upon the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain you meant to be generous, Billy,&rdquo;
his grandfather said kindly. &ldquo;You realize though
that those coins are very rare and valuable. Your
father gave them to you to keep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Grandfather. I didn&rsquo;t stop to think. I
only wanted to help. The Cubs had to pay for all
the damage done by the fire. I know &rsquo;cause I overheard
&rsquo;em talking about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Mr. Kain squirmed uncomfortably. Now that it
definitely was established the Cubs had been blameless
in the fire, he was ashamed to have taken their
money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little mistake was made,&rdquo; he said gruffly.</p>
<p>Colonel Brekenridge asked how much the Cubs
had been required to pay. Learning that the amount
was twenty dollars, he bade his nurse bring pen,
ink and a check book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy was entirely at fault,&rdquo; he told Mr. Kain.
&ldquo;It would be most unfair to hold the Cubs responsible
for damage. I&rsquo;ll gladly repay the amount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Brekenridge made out a check to Sam
Hatfield, instructing that each boy be repaid the
amount he had contributed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, we&rsquo;ll get our costumes for the play after
all!&rdquo; Dan said jubilantly. &ldquo;We can buy a lot of
special trappings!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoop-ee!&rdquo; chortled Midge, tossing his cap into
the air. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll win that contest yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to make a little contribution to help
along the cause,&rdquo; said Mr. Kain unexpectedly.</p>
<p>From his billfold, he extracted two new ten dollar
bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t necessary to repay us,&rdquo; Dan protested
quickly. &ldquo;Colonel Brekenridge already has done
that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is merely a little personal offering,&rdquo; the
bank employee said, thrusting the money into the
boy&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned a lesson in dealing with
the Cubs. Use this to buy whatever you need for your
play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Mr. Kain! And may we keep on using
the Castle grounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as you like, or at least until the place
is sold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Castle property is for sale?&rdquo; Colonel Brekenridge
inquired in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the bank has decided to get rid of it. The
property is a white elephant, eating up an enormous
amount in taxes and maintenance. It will be a bargain
though for anyone who can afford such a
mansion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that everything had been arranged to the
satisfaction of the Cubs, they had no further excuse
for remaining.</p>
<p>Brad arose from the steps and the other Cubs followed
his example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you have to go so soon?&rdquo; asked Billy, his
face becoming downcast. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you stay and play
with me just a little while? I&rsquo;ll let you use my bow
and arrow and my Ping-pong table.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>His words and manner made it instantly clear to
the Cubs that the boy suffered from loneliness.</p>
<p>This fact also became evident to Colonel Breckenridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as I said before, I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve
neglected you in recent months. Tell me, how do
you spend your time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the boy replied vaguely. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
nothing to do here. No one to play with ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that is why you&rsquo;ve roamed the woods and
found mischief for yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to do something, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Billy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could have had friends here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy gazed at the gardener and gave a snort.
&ldquo;Pete wouldn&rsquo;t let me! If I even let out a yip, he
would tell me to be quiet&mdash;that I was making you
worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Colonel Brekenridge quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever I did, the servants would tell me not
to make so much noise,&rdquo; Billy went on. &ldquo;The only
fun I had was watching the Cubs. I wish I could be
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; interposed Mr. Holloway heartily.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the right age, Billy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Also, you&rsquo;re mighty handy with a bow and arrow!&rdquo;
added Dan. &ldquo;You could teach us quite a few
tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy would be a real asset in our play,&rdquo; added
Brad. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re to win the prize, we need a few
fancy marksmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy&rsquo;s face had become highly animated. Springing
up from the steps, he gazed anxiously at his
grandfather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, may I join?&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;May I, Grandfather?
I promise I&rsquo;ll be as quiet as a mouse around
here and never make you nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel laughed. &ldquo;Billy, you&rsquo;re the same as a
Cub Scout right now, if the organization will take a
rascal like you! Furthermore, your days of tiptoeing
around lest you disturb me are at an end. I&rsquo;m well
on the road to recovery. A little healthy boy-noise
will do me good for a change!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy now turned to Mr. Hatfield, eagerly demanding
to know if he might be taken into the
organization.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we want you,&rdquo; the Cub leader assured
him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have the initiation as soon as possible.
Meanwhile, you may take part in all our activities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Robin Hood play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>Dan now spoke up. &ldquo;I think Billy should be Robin
Hood,&rdquo; he said generously. &ldquo;We all know he&rsquo;s a
better shot than anyone in the Pack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to be in the play, but I don&rsquo;t want the
lead part,&rdquo; Billy replied.</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway pointed out that many of the scenes
had been filmed. To place Billy in the leading role
at such a late date would mean retaking a great deal
of film.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find a role for him,&rdquo; he promised. &ldquo;Give me
time to think of something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys told Billy a little about the Cub organization
and particularly of their plans for the play.</p>
<p>They were amazed to learn that the boy not only
was thoroughly familiar with the Robin Hood story,
but had visited the real Nottingham Castle in England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be a big help to us in supplying
authentic detail for the play,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway assured
him.</p>
<p>Colonel Brekenridge remarked that it was approaching
the luncheon hour. He would not hear of
the Cubs leaving.</p>
<p>Instead, he invited them all to remain for a picnic
lunch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pete will look after everything,&rdquo; he said, chuckling
at his own joke. &ldquo;He likes visitors, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy was thrilled to think that the Cubs would
remain. He flew about, issuing orders to the servants
and telling them exactly what he wanted for lunch.
Double tables were set up under the trees and a
cloth was spread.</p>
<p>Although unable to join the group, Colonel Brekenridge
watched from his wheel chair on the veranda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does the story of Robin Hood end?&rdquo; Midge
asked, as the boys sat eating hamburger sandwiches.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never told us, Mr. Holloway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robin Hood had a long and merry life in Sherwood
Forest,&rdquo; the Den Dad responded. &ldquo;If we like,
we may end our story on that note. I was thinking
though, that an epilogue might be added. In this,
Billy could play the part of Robin Hood in his old
age, and shoot the last arrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does the epilogue go?&rdquo; asked Brad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story is this,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway explained.
&ldquo;Robin Hood had left England, but as springtime
returns, he craves again to roam the woodlands of
his beloved Sherwood Forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He renews acquaintance with his old friends,
Little John, Will Stutely, Allan-a-Dale and Midge,
the Miller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally he falls ill of a fever, and seeks the aid of
his cousin, the Prioress of Kirklees. The woman always
has disliked Robin Hood and plots to bring his
downfall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She locks him in a room of the tower and allows
him to weaken!&rdquo; declared Dan, who recalled the
story. &ldquo;A long while elapses before Little John hears
his faint cries for help. By the time he traces the call
and breaks down the oaken door, Robin Hood is on
the verge of death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway nodded, &ldquo;and when Robin
Hood realized that his hour had come, he bade
Little John string his stout bow for him and choose
a smooth arrow from his quiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then from his bed, Robin Hood prepared to
shoot through the open window. He directed Little
John to dig his grave where the arrow came to rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like a sad ending to a story,&rdquo; Midge protested.</p>
<p>The other Cubs, however, favored adding the epilogue.
They thought it not only would round up the
story with a most effective scene, but would give
Billy Brekenridge a chance to play a star part.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix myself up to look like an old man!&rdquo; the boy
declared happily. &ldquo;I can shoot that arrow from a
lying down position easy as anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout the morning, Mr. Kain had been increasingly
impressed not only by the Cubs but by
their plans for the Robin Hood play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will it be given?&rdquo; he asked Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>The Cub leader told him that plans had been
made to present the play before three judges the
following Saturday. An invitation also would be extended
to parents to witness the show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This play deserves a larger audience,&rdquo; Mr. Kain
declared enthusiastically. &ldquo;Why not put out posters
and invite the town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to do that, Mr. Kain. The boys have
worked hard. We were afraid though, that the bank
might not want so many people tramping over the
grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me take care of that,&rdquo; replied the bank employee.
&ldquo;After the way the Cubs saved the property
for us, I&rsquo;m sure we owe them a little something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs were delighted by Mr. Kain&rsquo;s change of
attitude.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>They were even more pleased when he went on,
saying: &ldquo;From watching rehearsals and listening to
an outline of the epilogue, I plainly see you&rsquo;re
handicapped by having to do all your scenes outdoors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we are, but that can&rsquo;t be helped,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not do the final scene inside the Castle at
the window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could it be arranged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it. I&rsquo;ll see the bank president this very
afternoon and let you know.&rdquo; Mr. Kain arose and
picked up his hat. &ldquo;Well, good-bye boys, and good
luck in winning the contest,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been most
educational knowing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Mr. Kain had gone, the Cubs remained for
another two hours at the Brekenridge estate. Billy
seemed pathetically eager for companionship.</p>
<p>He showed them about the grounds and displayed
his archery equipment. Not in the least boastful,
the boy, at request of the Cubs, demonstrated his
ability with bow and arrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve practiced for years,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My father
taught me in England. You&rsquo;ll all be as good or
better than I am, after you&rsquo;ve practiced awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We doubt that,&rdquo; laughed Dan. &ldquo;All the same, it
will come in handy having you to do a little behind-the-scenes
shooting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be your double,&rdquo; Billy volunteered. &ldquo;Whenever
a scene requires very accurate shooting, I can
substitute for you, but my face won&rsquo;t show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Details of the various scenes in which both boys
would take part were worked out. Then it was time
for the Cubs to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come again&mdash;soon?&rdquo; Billy asked wistfully,
escorting the group to the estate entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Dan told him. &ldquo;As often as we&rsquo;re invited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be every single day!&rdquo; Billy laughed.
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t forget your other promise&mdash;to make me
a Cub?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one can make you a Cub,&rdquo; Dan replied.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s up to you. You may be sure, though, we&rsquo;ll
take you into the organization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The initiation will be soon,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield promised.
&ldquo;Meanwhile, boys, let&rsquo;s all remember the Cub
motto&mdash;&lsquo;Do Your Best.&rsquo; If we&rsquo;re to win first in the
play contest, we all must put forth top effort.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER 20</span>
<br />Epilogue</h2>
<p>On the day set for the presentation of the Cubs&rsquo;
Robin Hood play, the boys of Dens 1 and 2 arrived
early at the Castle grounds.</p>
<p>The weather had favored them. A rain the previous
day had settled the dust and the air was pleasantly
cool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s perfect,&rdquo; Brad declared in satisfaction.
&ldquo;Now if we don&rsquo;t muff our lines, we&rsquo;re all set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Dan replied, none too confident.
&ldquo;I almost wish we had adopted Ross&rsquo; idea and put
on an Indian pow wow instead of such an elaborate
presentation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it!&rdquo; the Den Chief replied. &ldquo;Just
as Mr. Hatfield said, Indian shows are a dime a
dozen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one the Hi-Y Club put on was good though,
Brad. We have real competition.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>The previous night the Cubs had witnessed the
Indian skit presented by another competitor for the
grand prize. As Dan remarked, it had been very
good indeed.</p>
<p>Ten organizations finally had entered the contests.
Six of the performances had been of mediocre
caliber. The other three, however, definitely were in
the running for the prize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, the last things usually are best,&rdquo;
Brad encouraged his friend. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve worked hard
and we should win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should, but will we?&rdquo; Dan countered. &ldquo;The
shooting match is our big scene. If I should get
nervous and miss the target&mdash;that would ruin everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be nervous, Dan,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;Quit
your worrying. Now let&rsquo;s get into our costumes. The
crowd soon will arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the occasion, the bank had opened the Castle
to visitors. One room had been set aside as the
Cubs&rsquo; dressing quarters. Here all of the Cubs had
gathered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate, we have top-notch costumes,&rdquo;
Midge declared in satisfaction as he scrambled into
his tight-fitting suit of green. &ldquo;Thanks to Mr. Brekenridge
and the bank officials!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room buzzed with conversation. Red could
not find his cap with the yellow feather. Chips,
certain that he would forget his lines, kept mumbling
them over and over. Everyone talked at once,
and no one listened. Of the group, Billy Brekenridge
appeared the most calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had your confidence,&rdquo; Dan told him
enviously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t need any,&rdquo; the boy laughed. &ldquo;My
part is small, at the very end. I know I can shoot
Robin Hood&rsquo;s last arrow straight and true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I could be as sure of myself,&rdquo; Dan sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just relax and don&rsquo;t think about the crowd,&rdquo;
Billy advised him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve improved a lot in practice
this last week. You&rsquo;ll do fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd soon began to arrive, everyone seating
themselves on the grass near the Castle. Presently,
Mr. Hatfield brought word that the judges had
appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have news for you,&rdquo; he told the Cubs. &ldquo;The
judges may announce the winner of the contest at
conclusion of our performance. All the other plays
have been given, you know. Ours is the last one to
be graded.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they award us something for effort,&rdquo;
Chips said grimly.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield explained that the grading would be
according to strict rules. A certain number of points
were to be allowed for originality of material, a certain
number for costumes, stage direction, acting
ability, and general effectiveness.</p>
<p>By two o&rsquo;clock, the hour set for the start of the
play, a large throng had gathered on the Castle
grounds.</p>
<p>The Cubs were amazed to see Colonel Brekenridge
in the audience. He sat in the shade in his
wheel chair, accompanied by his nurse.</p>
<p>At last came the moment of starting. Four trumpeters
announced the opening with blasts from their
instruments.</p>
<p>Although all scenes had been taken many times,
Mr. Holloway had posted himself at an advantageous
position to make a final filming of the play.
It was planned that the picture later would be offered
to other organizations for showings.</p>
<p>The play began with the prologue in which Robin
Hood encountered Little John at the bridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>Their sprightly duel evoked much laughter from
the crowd and went off without a single mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even the judges were laughing,&rdquo; Brad whispered
to Fred. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing all right so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the play unfolded, the audience learned that a
reward of two hundred pounds had been offered for
Robin Hood&rsquo;s head, and that the Sheriff of Nottingham
had sworn he himself would seize the outlaw.</p>
<p>The Cubs were uncertain how Ross Langdon
would act his role. During practice he had alternately
sulked or clowned.</p>
<p>As it developed, the doubts proved needless. Ross
was as determined as the other Cubs to win honors
for the Pack. He spoke his lines carefully, and his
blustering manner exactly fitted the role.</p>
<p>Finally, came the vital scene of the play, the
shooting match at Nottingham Town.</p>
<p>When Dan&rsquo;s turn came to shoot, he could feel his
heart hammering against his ribs. The other archers
in the scene had shot their arrows flying into the
target.</p>
<p>And, as luck would have it, two of the shots had
been especially good. To uphold the role of Robin
Hood, he must beat both of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! Do your best, Dan,&rdquo; Midge whispered to
his friend. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to put an arrow in the
gold. It slipped away from me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan dared not look too long at the target. Drawing
the bow, he loosed the string.</p>
<p>For a moment he stood motionless, his eye fixed
upon his point of aim. He was afraid to hope. If the
arrow failed to beat the other two&mdash;the match was
a farce!</p>
<p>Then a shout went up and the audience began to
clap.</p>
<p>The arrow had flown straight and true, lodging
inside of the other two, and clipping a bit of feather
from the one Midge had shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; shouted Midge. &ldquo;A beautiful shot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The play moved on swiftly now to the epilogue.</p>
<p>In this final scene only Billy Brekenridge and
Brad appeared, the latter acting his role of Little
John.</p>
<p>Billy had been made up to look very old. Propped
on pillows, he reclined just inside the Castle, but
visible to the audience.</p>
<p>As the camera began to grind, Brad as Little John
opened wide the windows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>An amplifier carried Robin Hood&rsquo;s final words to
the audience. Speaking with a great deal of feeling,
Billy instructed Little John to make his last resting
place the spot where his arrow fell.</p>
<p>Then, raising himself upright, he drew the bowstring.
Out through the open window sped the
arrow. A perfect shot, it fell in a green bower directly
in view of the judges.</p>
<p>A blast from the trumpets signalled the end of the
performance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was swell, Billy!&rdquo; Brad cried, grasping his
hand. &ldquo;Your shot couldn&rsquo;t have been better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where that arrow fell we&rsquo;ll place our target for
the archery range,&rdquo; Billy said dreamily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it
all planned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad was too excited at the moment by the success
of the play to wonder what the boy meant.</p>
<p>Parents poured around the Cubs, congratulating
them upon their fine acting.</p>
<p>Though pleased that it was over, the Cubs were
none too confident of victory. The judges, they noticed,
had gone into a huddle. Apparently, they
were in disagreement, for they seemed to be arguing
rather heatedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No soap,&rdquo; Chips muttered hopelessly. &ldquo;I stumbled
over my lines in one place. I&rsquo;m sure that prejudiced
one judge. I saw him looking hard at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes elapsed. Then word came that the
judges were ready to announce their decision.
George Hutton, as spokesman for the group, stepped
out in front of the expectant audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The task of choosing the best play from among
ten entries has been most difficult,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;All
have had exceeding merit. In the unanimous opinion
of the judges, however, one presentation has
been outstanding in every respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Which</i> one?&rdquo; whispered Midge impatiently.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t he ever get to the point?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First prize is awarded to the Cub Scouts for their
play &lsquo;Robin Hood,&rsquo;&rdquo; Mr. Hutton announced. &ldquo;From
start to finish, the presentation was a <i>finished</i> production.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, there was no containing the pride of
the Cubs. As they talked gleefully of their success,
however, they gave full credit to Mr. Hatfield,
Midge&rsquo;s father, and to Brad and Dan who had contributed
so heavily of their time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Now that the winner had been announced, the
crowd began to leave. Mr. Holloway called the boys
together to thank them for their splendid effort and
to tell them that already he had received many requests
to show the Robin Hood film.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just think!&rdquo; Fred said jubilantly. &ldquo;Now that
we&rsquo;ve won the prize, we&rsquo;ll have a complete archery
set! Bows and arrows for everyone and targets!
We&rsquo;ll have a chance to really become experts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need an archery range though,&rdquo; Red
pointed out. &ldquo;Now that our play is finished, we can&rsquo;t
expect the bank to allow us to keep on using these
grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Fred admitted, a trifle crestfallen.
&ldquo;Well, at any rate, we&rsquo;ll have Billy here to teach us
how to shoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of Billy reminds me of an important
matter,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Hatfield, who had overheard
the conversation. &ldquo;Officially, he isn&rsquo;t a Cub yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we initiate him?&rdquo; demanded Chips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon, too,&rdquo; chimed in Dan. &ldquo;We need Billy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking the same thing,&rdquo; agreed the Cub
leader. &ldquo;Colonel Brekenridge is here now with his
nurse. He may never be able to come to one of our
meetings&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d like to see Billy taken into the organization!&rdquo;
Brad exclaimed. &ldquo;Why not induct him right
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the other Cubs favored the plan. Gathering
the boys in a circle, Mr. Hatfield briefly explained
the ideals and goals of the organization.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A real Cub is square,&rdquo; he told Billy. &ldquo;Also he is
reliable and loyal. He sticks by his friends. A Cub
prides himself upon being fair to others. Last but
far from least, he always tries to be cheerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cub leader then explained further that the
five ideals, SQUARE, LOYAL, FAIR, HAPPY and
GAME, were represented by the five fingers of the
Cub&rsquo;s left hand.</p>
<p>Billy then was asked to repeat the Cub Promise:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, Billy Brekenridge, promise to do my best, to
be square and to obey the law of the Cub Pack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of the Cubs of Dens 1 and 2 repeated the Law
of the Pack:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The Cub Follows Akela.</p>
<p class="t0">The Cub Helps the Pack Go.</p>
<p class="t0">The Pack Helps the Cub Grow.</p>
<p class="t0">The Cub Gives Good Will.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>The boys showed Billy the official handclasp and
how to make the Cub sign with the two first fingers
of the right hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a full fledged Bobcat now!&rdquo; Brad told
him when the ceremony had been completed. &ldquo;Work
hard and you&rsquo;ll soon be a Wolf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after that a Bear and a Lion!&rdquo; laughed Ross
Langdon. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard going though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Brekenridge, who had witnessed the ceremony,
asked his nurse to wheel him to the group.</p>
<p>Congratulating his grandson upon his entry into
the Cub organization, he then cordially invited the
boys to come to his estate whenever they felt the
urge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect to be living there long though,&rdquo;
he added. &ldquo;The place has been none too satisfactory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This information rather dashed the expectation
of the Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not moving away from Webster City,
Colonel Brekenridge?&rdquo; Dan questioned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d hate
to lose Billy right after taking him into the Den.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; the colonel reassured the boys. &ldquo;I expect
to make my home here. I have bought a place
of my own.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In this section of the city, I hope,&rdquo; Brad said
politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much so.&rdquo; Colonel Brekenridge smiled at
the boys, and added casually, &ldquo;In fact, you&rsquo;re standing
on my property now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;ve bought the Castle?&rdquo; Dan demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deal with the bank was completed yesterday.
I expect to finish the house as the designer
originally planned it. The grounds will be cleared
and replanted with shrubs and flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; Chips declared, and all the
boys nodded agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be welcome here at any time,&rdquo; the colonel
continued. &ldquo;For that matter, to make certain you&rsquo;ll
come, I may offer a few inducements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Picnic tables,&rdquo; suggested Billy eagerly. &ldquo;Outdoor
grills and fireplaces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; agreed his grandfather. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll cut
the brush from the woods and make interesting
trails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs can help with that work,&rdquo; volunteered
Dan.</p>
<p>Colonel Brekenridge smiled at his willingness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs have done their share of brush cutting,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I want this place to represent sheer
fun for the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, we&rsquo;re going to like that!&rdquo; laughed Midge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess SO!&rdquo; chuckled Red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs need an archery range,&rdquo; suggested
Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intended to ask about that,&rdquo; said his grandfather.
&ldquo;Billy, fetch a bow and arrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy ran to do his bidding. When he returned
with it, the colonel placed the bow in Dan&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Robin Hood, you must shoot this arrow
with care,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;For wherever it falls, there
shall be the Cubs&rsquo; future archery range.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know exactly the stretch we need!&rdquo; declared
Dan. &ldquo;If only I don&rsquo;t miss my aim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the other Cubs gathered about him, the boy
raised his bow and took careful aim.</p>
<p>Away sped the arrow, straight and true to fall to
earth exactly at the spot he had planned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There lies our future archery range,&rdquo; he said,
smiling at Billy. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to our success!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s to the best marksman,&rdquo; added Brad.
&ldquo;The Bobcat who taught us the tricks of Robin
Hood&rsquo;s trade!&rdquo;</p>
